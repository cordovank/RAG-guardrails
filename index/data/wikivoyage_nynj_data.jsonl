{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_New_York_City", "title": "New_York_City", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/New_York_City", "text": "**New York** (known as \"The Big Apple\", \"NYC,\" and often called \"New York City\") is a global center for media, entertainment, art, fashion, research, finance, and trade. The bustling, cosmopolitan heart of the 4th largest metropolis in the world and by far the most populous city in the United States, New York has long been a key entry point and a defining city for the nation.\n\nFrom the Statue of Liberty in the harbor to the Empire State Building towering over the Manhattan skyline, from the tunnels of the subway to the riches of Wall Street, from the bright signs of Times Square to the naturalistic beauty of Central Park, and from Yankee Stadium in the Bronx to Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York's landmarks are quintessential American landmarks. The city's neighborhoods and streets are so iconic they have become ingrained into the American consciousness. Here the power, wealth and culture of the United States is on full display in one of the largest and most iconic skylines in the world, in the food and music to be found around every corner, and in the diverse population of immigrants who come from every corner of the globe to take part in what this city has to offer.\n\nLying at the mouth of the Hudson River in the southernmost part of the state of the same name and at the center of the Mid-Atlantic region, New York City is home to approximately 8.3 million people. The New York Metropolitan Area, which spans lower New York state, northern New Jersey, and southwestern Connecticut, has a population of 18.9 million, making it the largest metropolitan area in the U.S.\n\n## Boroughs\n\n[edit]New York City consists of five **boroughs**, which are five separate counties. Each borough has a unique culture and could be a large city in its own right. Within each borough individual **neighborhoods**, some only a few blocks in size, have personalities lauded in music and film. Where you live, work, and play in New York says something to New Yorkers about who you are.\n\nThe five New York boroughs are:\n\nManhattan (New York County)The famous island between the Hudson and East Rivers where most of the skyscrapers are, with many diverse and unique neighborhoods. Manhattan is home to the Empire State Building in Midtown, Central Park, Times Square, Wall Street, Harlem, and the trendy neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and SoHo. It is also home to One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, which is the largest skyscraper in the western hemisphere as of 2023. |\n\nBrooklyn (Kings County)The most populous borough, and formerly a separate city, south and east of Manhattan across the East River. Known for artists, music venues, beaches, and Coney Island. |\n\nQueens (Queens County)U-shaped and located to the east of Manhattan, across the East River, and north, east, and south of Brooklyn. Queens is the home of the city's two international airports, the New York Mets professional baseball team, the United States Open Tennis Center, and New York City's largest Chinatown (in Flushing). With over 170 languages spoken, Queens is the most ethnically diverse region in the United States, and one of the most diverse in the world. |\n\nThe Bronx (Bronx County)North of Manhattan Island, the Bronx is home to the Bronx Zoo, the New York Botanical Gardens, and the city's beloved New York Yankees professional baseball team. |\n\nStaten Island (Richmond County)A large island in New York Harbor, south of Manhattan and just across the narrow Kill Van Kull from New Jersey. The borough has the unfortunate nickname of The Forgotten Borough, due to the fact that it lacks a subway connection and has a weaker political influence compared to the other boroughs. Unlike most of the rest of New York City, much of Staten Island has a somewhat suburban character. |\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]New York City is a major global center of international finance, politics, communications, film, music, fashion, and culture, and is among the world's most important and influential cities. It is home to many world-class museums, art galleries, and theaters. Many of the world's largest corporations have their headquarters here. The headquarters of the United Nations is in New York and most countries have a consulate here. This city's influence on the world and all its inhabitants is hard to overstate, as decisions made within its boundaries often have impacts and ramifications around the globe.\n\nImmigrants (and their descendants) from over 180 countries live here, making it one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Travelers are attracted to New York City for its culture, energy and cosmopolitanism.\n\n### History\n\n[edit]The first human settlers are believed to have arrived in the area at around 7000 BCE, though this settlement was later abandoned. A subsequent wave of settlers, known as the Lenape people, would then arrive at around 1000 BCE. Although they have been largely wiped out from the area since the days of European settlement, many of the thoroughfares used by them, such as Broadway, continue to be in use to this day.\n\nThe first Europeans to settle in the area were the Dutch in 1609, who named the colony New Amsterdam (Dutch: *Nieuw Amsterdam*). The colony was conquered by the British in 1664, who re-named the colony New York. Columbia University, the most prestigious in the city, and one of the most prestigious in the United States, was founded during the British colonial period in 1754.\n\nFor much of the War of Independence, New York City remained a British stronghold. The British only withdrew from the city in 1783, allowing George Washington's troops to march in and claim it for the United States of America. New York City became the first capital of the United States of America in 1789, though this status was short-lived as the capital was transferred to Philadelphia only a year later. Nevertheless, during that period, the first United States Congress was convened at what is now Federal Hall on Wall Street, and George Washington was also inaugurated as the first President of the United States on the steps of Federal Hall. The Supreme Court of the United States was first convened at the now-demolished Royal Exchange Building, which was adjacent to Federal Hall.\n\n### Orientation\n\n[edit]The borough of Manhattan is a long, narrow island nestled in a natural harbor. It is separated from The Bronx on the north east by the Harlem River (actually a tidal strait); from Queens and Brooklyn to the east and south by the East River (also a tidal strait); and from the State of New Jersey to the west and north by the Hudson River. Staten Island lies to the southwest, across Upper New York Bay.\n\nIn Manhattan, the terms “uptown” and “north” mean northeast, while “downtown” and “south” mean to the southwest. To avoid confusion, simply use “uptown” and “downtown.” Street numbers continue from Manhattan into the Bronx, and the street numbers rise as one moves farther uptown (however, in the Bronx, there is no simple numerical grid, so there may be 7 blocks between 167 St. and 170 St., for example). Avenues run north and south. In Brooklyn, street numbers rise as one moves south. Queens streets are laid out in a perpendicular grid – street numbers rise as one moves toward the east, and avenues run east and west. Staten Island's grid system is small and insignificant, only covering one neighborhood.\n\nThe term “the city” may refer either to New York City as a whole, or to the borough of Manhattan alone, depending on the context. The other boroughs - Brooklyn, The Bronx, Staten Island, and Queens - are sometimes referred to as the \"outer boroughs.”\n\n### Climate\n\n[edit]| New York City | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Climate chart (explanation) | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|\n\nThere has been a pronounced local warming trend in New York City since the 1990s, but the climate is still temperate, except in the summer. Due to its proximity to the humid continental climate zone of the north, it generally experiences all four seasons, with hot and humid summers (Jun-Sept), mild to cool falls (Sept-Nov), mild to very cold winters (Dec-Mar), and increasingly mild, wet springs (Mar-Jun). Average highs for January are around 38°F (3°C) and average highs for July are about 84°F (29°C). However, temperatures in the winter can go down to as low as 0°F (-18°C), although periods of sustained extreme cold with highs in the teens or low 20s for two weeks or more are increasingly a thing of the past, whereas what used to be freakish temperatures in the 70s in midwinter are increasingly common, and in the summer, temperatures can go above 100°F (38°C). Summer heat indices factoring in humidity are around 87 °F (31 °C) during the day and 71 °F (22 °C) at night, though it's not unheard of for heat indices to climb up to or exceed 100 °F (38 °C) and not go below 78 °F (26 °C) at night. The temperature in any season is quite variable and it is not unusual to have a sunny 60°F (16°C) day in January followed by a snowy 25°F (-4°C) day. New York can also be prone to snowstorms and nor'easters (large storms similar to a tropical storm), which can dump as much as 2 feet (60 cm) of rain and/or snow in 24–48 hours. Although snowstorms occur during the winter months, some winters see very little snow, and snow rarely lies more than a few days before it melts. Major snowstorms can happen as early as Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November) and as late as the second week in April, though this is increasingly rare and not the norm. Tropical storms can also hit New York City in the summer and early fall, and with climate change occurring apace, they can bring truly torrential rains that cause flooding in places. The sun is up during the summer from 5:30AM to 8:30PM, and 7:15AM to 4:30PM in the winter.\n\n### People\n\n[edit]The diverse population runs the gamut from some of America's wealthiest celebrities and socialites to homeless people. New York's population, formed by millions of immigrants, has been diverse since the city's founding by the Dutch, and successive waves of immigration from virtually every nation in the world make New York a giant social experiment in cross-cultural harmony.\n\nThe city's ethnic heritage illuminates different neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs. Manhattan's Chinatown remains a vibrant center of New York City's Chinese community, though the very large Chinese community in Flushing, Queens, has rivaled if not eclipsed it in importance, and three other Chinatowns have formed in New York City: the Brooklyn Chinatown in Sunset Park; the Elmhurst Chinatown in Queens; and the Avenue U Chinatown in the Homecrest section of Brooklyn. Traces of the Lower East Side's once-thriving Jewish community still exist amid the gentrified neighborhood's trendy restaurants and bars, but there are Chasidic communities in Borough Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Harlem has been gentrifying and diversifying and remains a center of African-American culture in New York. East (Spanish) Harlem, though also significantly gentrified, still justifies its reputation as a large Hispanic neighborhood. Little known to most tourists are the large Dominican neighborhoods of Hamilton Heights and Washington Heights in upper Manhattan. Brooklyn's Greenpoint is famous for its formerly large and vibrant Polish community, of which only a bit remains, and the Flatbush section - once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers - is today a huge and thriving Caribbean and West Indian section. Queens and Brooklyn are known for being home to many of New York's immigrant groups, which since 1990 have included large numbers of Russians, Uzbeks, Chinese, Irish, French, Filipinos, Yugoslavians, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Japanese, Koreans, Thais, Africans, Arabs (from throughout the Middle East and northern Africa), Persians, Mexicans, Dominicans, Ecuadorians, Puerto Ricans, Brazilians, Colombians and Jamaicans. Queens is the single most diverse area on Earth, having the most languages and ethnic groups living in one place.\n\n### Economy\n\n[edit]New York City is home to 46 of the Fortune 500 companies. Its gross metropolitan product of $1.7 trillion is the largest of any American city and represents roughly 9% of the American economy. If it were a nation, the city would have the 16th-highest GDP in the world.\n\nNew York is the national center for several industries. It is the home of the three largest U.S. stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX) and many banking and investment firms. Though these companies have traditionally been located in the area around Wall Street in the Financial District, many have offices in other parts of the city, such as Midtown. New York is the hub of the country's publishing, fashion, accounting, advertising, media, legal, theater, and art industries. The city boasts several top-tier hospitals and medical schools, which train more physicians than those in any other city in the world.\n\n### Visitor information\n\n[edit]## Talk\n\n[edit]English is the primary language spoken by most New Yorkers, although it is common to hear other languages from around the world. There are many Spanish-speaking neighborhoods with large Latino populations (especially several neighborhoods in the Bronx, Bushwick, Corona, Jackson Heights, Washington Heights, East Harlem and West Harlem), and it is possible, albeit somewhat difficult, for a non-English-speaking tourist to get by in New York speaking only Spanish. Many establishments in the main commercial and tourist areas have Spanish-speaking staff on duty. Cantonese is the main language among New York City's Chinese community, though a significant minority are immigrants from Fuzhou and hence speak the Fuzhou dialect; some speak Mandarin. You can expect to hear Russian spoken on the streets in parts of South Brooklyn, and Yiddish or Hebrew in other parts. In some of these neighborhoods, some locals may not speak very good English, but store owners and those who would deal frequently with tourists or visitors will generally speak English. Most municipal government services in New York City are available in English, Spanish, Chinese, and Russian. Because of a massive wave of immigration of Italians in the late 19th and early 20th century, Italian was once a major language — primarily the southern dialects (Napuletano, Siciliano, Calabrese, etc.). You can still hear them in Italian neighborhoods, along with Italian-American dialects of the younger generations. The more standardized Italian has been brought by 21st-century immigrants who tend to be young business professionals, as opposed to the much larger wave of working class southern Italian immigrants before them.\n\nThe upside to this linguistic confusion is that, while you can find a restaurant or other establishment for nearly every culture somewhere in Manhattan, catering to English-speaking tourists, more adventurous travelers may be able to find a more authentic experience for less money among an ethnic community somewhere in the outer boroughs.\n\nTraditionally, English in New York City was spoken with distinctive accents, which differed according to ethnicity, neighborhood and social class (compare the Queens accent of Donald Trump with the Brooklyn accent of Bernie Sanders, both New Yorkers, as an example). Some of these accents are notable for being among the few non-rhotic American accents. You may still encounter the traditional accents when talking to older working-class New Yorkers. Due to its large Ashkenazi Jewish population, many Yiddish terms have also made their way into local English slang. You may also hear the New York dialect of **African-American Vernacular English** (AAVE) being spoken among African-Americans, and a distinctive dialect known as **New York Latino English**, with noticeable influences from Puerto Rican and Dominican Spanish, is spoken by many Latinos. The long-established Jewish American and Italian-American communities have developed their own dialects that can still be heard throughout the city.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]### By plane\n\n[edit]New York City (**NYC ** IATA for all airports) is well connected by air with flights from almost every corner of the world. Three large airports, and several small ones, serve the region. John F. Kennedy International Airport (**JFK** IATA) and Newark Liberty International Airport (**EWR** IATA) are large international airports, while LaGuardia Airport (**LGA** IATA) is a busy domestic airport. All three airports are run by The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nInter-airport transfers:\n\n**Bus/subway**- Connections between airports using the bus/subway/PATH trains are the cheapest option, but will require many transfers. Set aside a*minimum*of 2 hours for travel time.- Go Airlink Shuttle - Shared van service to or from most of Manhattan.\n**Shared ride van services**- Some companies as ETS Airport Shuttle and All County Express run very infrequent shared ride van service between airports.**Taxis**- the fastest option when changing airports. A taxi between JFK and LGA will cost about $25–29 and should take 30 minutes. A taxi between LGA and EWR will cost about $78 + tolls and should take 60–75 minutes. A taxi between JFK and EWR will cost about $85 + tolls and should take 60–75 minutes.\n\nNote: Taxi scammers\nScammers outside of the arrivals terminals at JFK will offer their services, claiming to be Uber drivers and that their original fare cancelled their ride. In many cases they will show the Uber logo either on a sign or on a smartphone.\nIf somebody like this approaches you, simply and firmly say “No.” Do not let them touch any of your luggage and do not allow them to intimidate you in any way. Do not hesitate to call the police on 911 if the scammers persist. The authorities will always back you in such incidents, despite the scammer's threats of possible arrest or deportation. | |\n(Information last updated 05 Sep 2025) |\n\n#### John F. Kennedy International Airport\n\n[edit]1 John F. Kennedy International Airport (**JFK** IATA). New York's main airport and a major hub for American, Delta, and JetBlue, as well as other domestic and international airlines. If you are arriving into New York by plane from overseas, it is likely that JFK will be your point of entry.\n\nIf you arrive at this airport from overseas, be prepared to wait in line at Customs & Border Protection, often over an hour if you are not a permanent resident of the United States. As cellphones are not allowed in waiting lines, you may want to bring a book or other non-digital entertainment. If you are departing from this airport, beware that it's a huge and *congested* airport with six terminals. Make sure you know what terminal you're leaving from before you get to the airport, and it's recommended that you arrive 2 hours before domestic flights and 3 hours before international ones, to check in and pass through security without a huge increase in blood pressure and/or a last minute dash worthy of the Olympics, but without any of the medals.\n\nIf you're going to Manhattan, you can get there by **taxi** for a flat fare of $70, **bus/subway** for $2.90, or the **JFK** **AirTrain** — a 24-hr people mover system that takes passengers to the nearby **Jamaica** subway and **LIRR** stations for $8.50. From Jamaica you can take NYC subway lines E, J or Z further into Brooklyn, Queens and onward to the island of Manhattan, with travel time being between 50 and 60 minutes to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan. A faster option for those in the know is the **Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)**; these commuter trains can whisk you from Jamaica to Penn Station in roughly 20-25 minutes. Jamaica is a *major* hub for LIRR train services — only use this option if you are sure of what you're doing. You don't want to get on the wrong train and end up far from your destination. To add insult to injury, unforgiving conductors on the LIRR will charge you on the spot for incorrect tickets. Best to use this option once you have fully done your research or consulted with a local. LIRR trains are extremely crowded both toward and away from New York City during rush hours.\n\nTraffic can be horrendous at all hours, in all directions. If you are driving or taking a taxi to or from JFK, leave yourself plenty of time to get to or from the airport.\n\n#### Newark Liberty International Airport\n\n[edit]2 Newark Liberty International Airport (**EWR** IATA). In the state of New Jersey, west of Manhattan, serves as New York's second major international airport, New Jersey's primary airport, and a major hub for United Airlines.\n\nYou can get into New York City by **taxi** for $50-70. Other taxi companies that run cabs to different destinations are also available from the airport. For a cheaper option, take the **train**: the NJ Transit commuter rail to New York Penn Station takes about 30 minutes and costs $16.80 each way.\n\nNew Jersey Transit Bus #62 and other NJT Buses — The most inexpensive option, New Jersey Transit #62 bus runs from in front of all 3 airport terminals to Newark Penn Station (one-way fare $1.80; exact change only; 25 min). From there, you may take a PATH subway train ($3) either to World Trade Center station in lower Manhattan (25 min), or, to Journal Square, where you can transfer to the Journal Square-33rd St train across the platform, which runs to the following stops along 6th Ave: Christopher St in Greenwich Village, 9th St, 14th St, 23rd St, and 33rd St. Plan on 90 minutes including waiting times. The #62 Bus operates 24/7 between Elizabeth and Newark Penn Station, including holidays. Service generally runs every 10-15 minutes weekdays, 15-20 minutes Saturdays, and 20-30 minutes Sundays, with overnight service every 30 minutes.\n\nThe **AirTrain Newark** is easily accessed from the airport terminals via elevator/escalators and runs 24 hours to Newark Airport Rail Station, 10 min away, however, there's an $8.50 fee when exiting/entering to the Newark Airport Station (the $8.50 fee is included in the $16.80 NJ Transit train ticket). From here you can take a NJ Transit train (30-min ride, every 15-30 min) to New York Penn Station (34th St & 8th Ave in Manhattan) or Amtrak train to other destinations along the east coast. Amtrak also runs trains to Manhattan, but they cost $20-30. NJ Transit tickets are not valid on Amtrak trains. NJ Transit trains stop at both Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station, so if your destination is Manhattan, stay on till you reach New York Penn Station.\n\nNewark Airport's station along the Northeast Corridor gives it a major advantage over JFK and LGA, as long-distance **Amtrak** trains coming from as far south as Virginia, as far north as Massachusetts, and as far west as Harrisburg also stop at the station.\n\n#### LaGuardia Airport\n\n[edit]3 LaGuardia Airport (**LGA** IATA). The smallest of the New York Metropolitan Area's three major airports, but also the closest to Midtown Manhattan. Almost all direct flights to LGA are from destinations within 1,500 miles. Most flights are domestic; however, there are international flights from Canada, Aruba, the Bahamas and Bermuda. The Art Deco *Marine Air Terminal*, used by Spirit Airlines, is one of the oldest airport terminals that is still in use in the world. LaGuardia used to be a dump, but the airport was completely rebuilt in the early 2020s and it is now quite pleasant to use.\n\nLaGuardia does not have a direct rail or subway connection to the rest of the city. Your best bet for reaching Manhattan is to take a taxi or use a rideshare app. Most taxi or rideshare fares to Midtown Manhattan from LaGuardia will average $40-45 before tip. Trips via the Queens-Midtown Tunnel or RFK Bridge will incur a toll in addition to the fare. Traffic between Manhattan and LaGuardia can be awful during rush hours but generally is not a big issue outside of peak commuting times. If you feel comfortable using public transportation, two MTA Select Bus Service routes serve the airport. These buses can be very crowded at times but they do include luggage racks and operate 24 hours a day with a fair degree of frequency. The **M60-SBS** can take you to the area of Upper Manhattan around Columbia University via the Astoria neighborhood of Queens and 125th Street in Harlem. The **Q70-SBS** **LaGuardia Link** provides a connection to busy public transit hubs in the Woodside and Jackson Heights neighborhoods of Queens, where you can then connect onward to multiple subway, LIRR and bus lines. As of late 2022, riding the Q70 is free of charge. The M60 costs the standard bus fare of $2.90 per passenger.\n\n#### Long Island MacArthur Airport\n\n[edit]**Long Island MacArthur Airport**(Islip Airport) (**ISP**IATA) is 45 miles east of midtown Manhattan in Ronkonkoma in the Town of Islip on Long Island. The airport is served by Southwest Airlines, a major discount carrier. To travel between ISP and the city:**A shuttle bus**(10 minutes, $5) operates between ISP and the Ronkonkoma Long Island Railroad station. From there, you can take a train to Penn Station in Manhattan. (1.5 hours, $12.75 off-peak hours or $17.50 peak hours). The Long Island Railroad offers a discount package for MacArthur Airport travelers[dead link].**Hampton Jitney**operates bus services from Ronkonkoma to Manhattan costing $40-47; the bus stop is a short cab ride away from ISP.**SCT 6 bus**operates from the airport to Central Islip Station for $2.25. However, it isn't coordinated with the train schedule like the shuttle.\n\n\n#### Westchester County Airport\n\n[edit]**Westchester County Airport**(**HPN**IATA) is 25 miles northeast of midtown Manhattan near the town of White Plains and is served by American, Cape Air, Delta, JetBlue, and United, mostly for flights on the East Coast. To travel between the city and HPN:**Bee-Line Bus #12**(fare $2.75; ☏ +1-914-813-7777 for details) operates service to the White Plains Metro-North station. From there, you can take a Metro-North train ($9.75 off-peak and $12.75 peak) to any of various points in the Bronx, or 125th St/Park Ave and Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. Trains run roughly every half hour for most of the day and take approximately 40 minutes to an hour.\n\n\n#### Stewart International Airport\n\n[edit]**Stewart International Airport**(**SWF**IATA) is 75 miles north of midtown Manhattan, near Newburgh. It mainly serves flights from Florida. To travel between the city and SWF:- A shuttle bus ($1, 40 minutes, M-F only) connects SWF with the Beacon Metro-North Railroad Station. From there, you can take a train into Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan ($17.50 off-peak, $23 peak, approximately 90 minutes).\n- Shortline operates bus service ($20, 90 minutes) between the airport and the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. Buses are timed based on arrivals and departures of Norwegian Airlines flights.\n\n\n#### Trenton-Mercer Airport\n\n[edit]**Trenton-Mercer Airport**([dead link]**TTN**IATA) is 63 miles southwest of Midtown Manhattan and offers limited commercial service on Frontier Airlines. Passengers flying into Trenton can reach Manhattan by taking a taxi to the Trenton train station and then taking the New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor Line or Amtrak to Penn Station.**Teterboro Airport**(**TEB**IATA) is the most popular choice for general aviation and business jet travelers out of New York City. Air taxi and air charter companies such as Private Jets Teterboro. The Early Air Way, Monarch Air Group, Mercury Jets and Jetset Charter[dead link]fly a variety of private charter aircraft and jets, from charter luxury Gulfstream's down to economical piston twins for small groups and individuals.\n\n### By train\n\n[edit]#### Amtrak\n\n[edit]Amtrak, ☏ +1 215-856-7924, toll-free: +1-800-872-7245. Operates trains throughout the United States. Amtrak trains stop at 4 Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station (Amtrak code NYP), 351 West 31st Street (directly under Madison Square Garden, between 31st and 33rd St, and between 8th and 9th Ave). Popular trains leaving during rush hours can fill up quickly; it is a good idea to make reservations online, or via phone, and pick up your ticket using a credit card or your confirmation number at one of the electronic kiosks throughout the station. On some of the non-business routes, for example New York to Montreal, Amtrak takes more time and costs more money than taking the bus or renting a car. Check and compare schedules and prices before booking.\n\nAmtrak's routes stopping at Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station include:\n\n**Acela**travels multiple times daily between Boston and Washington, D.C. with stops in Westwood, Providence, New Haven, Stamford, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore. The train provides up to 150 mph (240 km/h) intercity service between major points along the east coast.

Stops between Niagara Falls (New York) and New York City are the same as those made by the Empire Service. Border crossing processing takes place in Niagara Falls, where passengers must detrain with their baggage. Train crew members are staffed by VIA Rail within Canada, and by Amtrak within the United States. Travel time to New York City from Toronto is 13 hours.**Northeast Regional**is Amtrak's busiest regional service, connecting Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and the many towns and cities in-between. Toward the east end of the route, some trips terminate at Springfield instead of Boston. Some services also continue south into Virginia towards Newport News, Roanoke and Norfolk on three separate branch routes from Alexandria. This is also Amtrak's most frequent service, with multiple daily departures. It provides a similar service to the Acela with somewhat inferior passenger car interiors, while being only marginally slower for much lower prices and having more stops.**Palmetto**between Savannah and New York City.**Silver Meteor**and**Silver Star**between Miami and New York City via Savannah.**Vermonter**operates daily between St. Albans and Washington, D.C. including stops in Essex Junction, Waterbury, Montpelier, White River Junction, Claremont, Bellows Falls, Brattleboro, Greenfield, Northampton, Holyoke, Springfield, Windsor Locks, Hartford, Meriden, New Haven, Bridgeport, Stamford, New York City, Newark, Trenton, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Baltimore, and New Carrollton.\n\nService from California, Oregon or Washington states takes about 4 days and requires a change of train in Chicago.\n\nAmtrak's ClubAcela Lounge, near the big security desk in Penn Station, offers complimentary drinks, wi-fi access, newspapers and magazines, and clean bathrooms. Access to the club is granted to travelers with sleeper tickets, First Class Acela tickets, or Amtrak GuestRewards SelectPlus membership.\n\n#### Commuter rail\n\n[edit]New York City is served by three commuter railroads:\n\n-\n**Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)**operates primarily between Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station or 5 Grand Central Madison in Midtown Manhattan, or 6 Atlantic Terminal in Downtown Brooklyn and a constellation of suburbs on Long Island. Stops within New York City include smaller stations as well as larger commuter hubs like Jamaica, Nostrand Avenue and Woodside. As a tourist, you will most likely not use the LIRR but for seasoned visitors, it can be a useful and relatively quick method for traveling between Penn Station and JFK Airport. LIRR tickets can be purchased online or inside stations prior to boarding the train. Tickets are also available for purchase on the train but are significantly more expensive. The cost of the ticket varies based on the distance of the ride. The LIRR system is complex and*not*particularly tourist-friendly: trains can be extremely crowded at peak commuting hours and on weekend evenings headed into NYC (when they're packed with younger people heading to bars and clubs—in various states of inebriation). LIRR trains operate 24 hours a day, but service can be infrequent or suspended overnight or during holidays on some lines. -\n**Metro-North Railroad (Metro-North)**operates between 7 Grand Central Terminal and points north and northeast of the city all the way to Connecticut. Trains also stop at the Harlem station on 125th Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan. The New Haven line serves cities along the coast with branch lines to Danbury and Waterbury. The Hudson Line serves points along the Hudson River like Tarrytown, Croton-Harmon, Peekskill, and Cold Spring, and terminating at Poughkeepsie. The Harlem Line serves Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess Counties to White Plains, Brewster, and Southeast, the station that provides shuttle service to Wassaic. At New Haven, passengers may transfer to Amtrak or to the*Shore Line East*providing local service between New Haven and New London, Connecticut. Metro North tickets can be purchased online or inside stations prior to boarding the train. Tickets are also available for purchase on the train but are significantly more expensive. The cost of the ticket varies based on the distance of the ride. The Metro-North is decidedly more calm and user-friendly compared to the LIRR, but trains can still be very crowded at peak hours going into or out of the city. Metro-North trains do not operate 24 hours a day. -\n**New Jersey Transit**operates between Moynihan Train Hall at NY Penn Station or 8 Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, and points in New Jersey. It is the only commuter railroad in New York City that isn't owned by the MTA. The Northeast Corridor line goes to Princeton and Trenton. Services are also available for points along the Jersey Coast via the North Jersey Coast Line, and to north-central suburbs like Summit, Peapack-Gladstone, or Morristown via the Morris & Essex Line, which is divided into the Morristown Line and Gladstone Branch. It also services the town of Montclair via the Montclair-Boonton line. With a transfer in 9 Secaucus Junction. or a PATH or ferry connection in Hoboken, to points north of the city (in New Jersey and New York State west of the Hudson), via the Pascack Valley and Bergen/Main/Port Jervis lines. The Raritan Valley Line serves some western suburbs, and is accessed via a PATH connection in 10 Newark Penn Station. , which is in Newark, New Jersey. Connecting service is available from Trenton to Philadelphia via SEPTA or to Camden (New Jersey) via RiverLINE. Connecting service to Newark Liberty International Airport is available from some Northeast corridor trains. NJ Transit tickets can be purchased online or inside stations prior to boarding the train. Tickets are also available for purchase on the train but are significantly more expensive. The cost of the ticket varies based on the distance of the ride.\n\n#### PATH\n\n[edit]PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) is a subway system connecting New York City to Hoboken, Newark, and various points on the New Jersey shore of the Hudson River. Two lines pass under the Hudson and enter the city, one terminating near the World Trade Center site downtown, the other at 33rd Street in midtown (see map[dead link]). The PATH station at 33rd Street is not connected to, nor part of Penn Station.\n\nPATH costs $3 per ride. PATH payment options:\n\n- You can use contactless payment options (eg a credit/debit card or a smartphone wallet) to pass through dedicated gates via the Total Access PATH Payment (TAPP) pilot. TAPP-enabled gates are available at every PATH station.\n- An RFID-type stored value card called\n*Smartlink*affords PATH users discounts: $26 for 10 trips; $52 for 20 trips; $104 for 40 trips. However, the card itself must be purchased ($5, $57 including 20 trips). - The PATH system accepts the MTA system's Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard\n[dead link](but not Unlimited Ride MetroCard). For the visitor traveling from New Jersey daily, it is more convenient and possibly cheaper to purchase the MetroCard to travel on both the PATH and the MTA systems. However, there is no free MetroCard transfer between PATH and MTA subways/buses.\n\nTAPP and Smartlink are separate from the New York City OMNY payment system. PATH does not accept OMNY RFID cards, and PATH trips do not contribute to the OMNY weekly fare cap.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]Some buses offer wi-fi, outlets and even business-class style luxury. Buses serve New Jersey, New York suburbs west of the Hudson River, and all cities along the east coast of the U.S.\n\n- 11 Port Authority Bus Terminal, 625 8th Ave (Along 8th Ave between 40th & 42nd Sts, near Times Square), ☏ +1 212-564-8484.

In addition to passenger service from the Cunard Line, many cruise ships start or end their voyages in New York City.\n\n**The Cunard Line**operates regularly scheduled passenger service between the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal and Southampton, United Kingdom as well as Hamburg, Germany aboard the**RMS Queen Mary 2**, the grandest, largest ocean liner ever built. The trip takes 6–7 days and costs $800–6,000 depending on the cabin and season.- More mundane arrivals can be had from New Jersey via\n**NY Waterway**and**SeaStreak**, two fast ferry services.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]While most people would advise against entering New York City by car (see the \"Get around\" section below), it is accessible by a number of highways:\n\nFrom New Jersey there are three Hudson River crossings: The George Washington Bridge (on I-95, US 1 and US 9) in Fort Lee drops you off in Upper Manhattan, the Lincoln Tunnel (on NJ Route 495) in Weehawken will bring you to Midtown Manhattan, and the Holland Tunnel (on I-78) in Jersey City leaves you in lower Manhattan. Depending on where you are heading to in New York City and the time of day, you'll want to take advantage of the different crossings, but if you have the time and are looking for the most scenic of the three, take the George Washington Bridge's upper level for spectacular views of New York City; Hudson County, New Jersey; and the Hudson River. If you are heading to Staten Island, Queens or Brooklyn you can also take the Goethals Bridge (on I-278) in Elizabeth; the highway cuts across Staten Island and continues over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to Brooklyn. The other routes into Staten Island from NJ are the Outerbridge Crossing in Perth Amboy, which puts you in Tottenville near the southern tip of the island, and the Bayonne Bridge, which leaves you in extreme northern Staten Island.\n\nFrom Upstate New York, you can take one of several highways into the Bronx, including the New York State Thruway, which becomes the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx (both roads are I-87). The Connecticut Turnpike/New England Thruway (I-95) and the Merritt Parkway/Hutchinson River Parkway are good routes from Connecticut and areas of Westchester County near the Long Island Sound. From Long Island you can take the Long Island Expressway (I-495) or the Northern State Parkway/Grand Central Parkway for access to Queens, the Bronx and Manhattan. The Southern State and Belt Parkways are useful for Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island.\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]|\n\"Left luggage\"\nBecause of security concerns, there are very few left luggage, storage lockers, or coat-check service at |\n\n### On foot\n\n[edit]For shorter distances, there is no better way of getting around New York than hitting the sidewalk. If you use the subway or buses, you will almost certainly need to walk to and from stations or stops. In all areas of New York a traveler is likely to visit, all streets have wide, smoothly-paved sidewalks. For long distances, walking is also fine and a great way to see the city.\n\nWear shoes that protect your feet and you don't mind getting a bit dirty, such as sneakers or platform wedges. The sidewalks can be filthy, especially on trash day. Women all over the city routinely pack high heels, strappy sandals, or flip flops in a bag and put them on only after arriving at their destinations.\n\n### Public transit – buses and subways\n\n[edit]**OMNY** is the MTA's contactless payment system, which allows passengers at all subway stations and on all MTA buses to pay by \"tapping\" their credit card or smart device equipped with Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or Fitbit Pay. If you tap in with a physical credit card the first time, you can not use that same credit card loaded on a mobile wallet for a second tap (including to transfer between buses or the subway); you must still use the physical card. OMNY uses a large reader module with an LCD display mounted to the front of subway turnstiles and beside fare boxes on local buses. On Select Bus Service vehicles, OMNY readers are situated beside all boarding doorways; you do not need to utilize the SBS ticket machines found at stops. OMNY offers a fare cap: if you take 12 paid OMNY trips with the same device or card within a 7-day window, you’ll automatically ride free for the rest of the week. Reduced fares are available on OMNY; riders eligible for a reduced fare need to specify a single payment device which will be charged their lower fare.\n\nPATH trains between New Jersey and New York City offer two contactless payment methods. You can use a contactless payment device such as a credit card or smartphone wallets on the **Total Access PATH Payment (TAPP)** trial gates, or use a physical RFID card called **SmartLink**. Smartlink cards will NOT work on contactless OMNY readers for MTA subways or buses once in New York City, so visitors moving between New Jersey and New York City frequently may prefer the convenience of TAPP.\n\n**MetroCard** is the tried-and-true pre-paid debit card for transit fares that will be phased out by 2026. MetroCards, which cost $1, can be bought online, at station booths, and at vending machines in subway stations, as well as at newsstands and some bodegas and convenience stores. The vending machines in the stations accept credit cards; however, MetroCard vending machines will require that you type in your 5-digit zip code, or your regular PIN on international cards. You can add either value or time (i.e. unlimited trips) to your MetroCard at vending machines in stations. Unlimited Ride MetroCards may not be used in rapid succession at the same subway station or on the same bus route. MetroCards generally expire 1 year after purchase; the expiration date is printed on the back of the card at the upper left.\n\nThe PATH rapid transit rail system between New York and New Jersey has a separate fare structure. PATH accepts payment by MetroCard, but no free transfers are available to or from MTA subways or buses. JFK AirTrain also accepts MetroCard, but again there are no free transfers available.\n\nMetro-North Commuter Railroad, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), New Jersey Transit (NJT), and Amtrak trains do not accept MetroCards, but Westchester Bee Line Buses, Roosevelt Island Tram, and NICE Bus (Nassau Inter-County Express) do accept[dead link] them. OMNY is accepted on all subway stations and MTA-operated buses as well as Metro-North and LIRR; however it will *not* work on NJ Transit as NJT will be using a different fare payment system.\n\nUp to three children 44 inches (112 cm) tall and under ride for free on subways and local buses when accompanied by a fare paying adult.\n\nMetroCards generally expire 1 year after purchase; the expiration date is printed on the back of the card at the upper left.\n\nA $1 fee is charged for each MetroCard purchased at station booths and vending machines. This fee does not apply when buying a card from neighborhood merchants, who may insist to be paid cash only (even if they otherwise accept credit cards with displayed logos), and if so, buy a lowest available pre-valued[dead link] $11.00 card that may be later refilled at MetroCard vending machine with credit card. However, expired MetroCards can be exchanged at station booths and vending machines free of charge, and the remaining balance will also be transferred to the new card. Most vending machines accept cash, but only return up to $9 in change. Debit and credit cards are accepted at vending machines; international card users need to input '99999' on the keypad when the ZIP code is requested. However, staffed station booths only accept cash, and no $50 bill if buying less than $30 or $100 bill if buying less than $70.\n\n**Single Ride MetroCard**– costs $3 and is good for one use. It allows no free transfers between the subway and bus, and it is only valid for two hours after purchase.**Pay-Per-Ride (Regular) MetroCards**– are available in amounts from $5.50 to $80. Each local bus or subway trip deducts $2.90 from your card; each express buses trip deducts $6.75. Usage of the PATH system deducts $2.75, and usage of JFK AirTrain deducts $8.25. You can add more money to your MetroCard at a later time.\n\nThe amount you should add is (*number of rides* × $2.90). Regular MetroCard is the best option if you are spending a few days in New York and plan to use the subway or bus fewer than 12 times.\n\n- Additionally, a Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard or OMNY tap allows for one\n**free transfer**during a two-hour window immediately following a paid fare:- From subway to local bus\n- From local bus to subway\n- From local bus to local bus (but not to any bus on the same route as the first)\n- From express bus to subway\n- From express bus to local bus\n- From express bus to express bus (but not to any bus on the same route as the first)\n\n\n- A Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard may be used to pay for up to four fares at one time at a subway turnstile or bus.\n- You can transfer from subway to subway as often as you like, provided that you do not exit the subway system by leaving through a turnstile or gate. Many subway connections are possible in this way, by using in-station connections between the various lines. Indeed, the Guinness Book of World Records tracks the fastest times of groups that have tried to ride every single New York City subway train line on one fare - some have spent over 24 consecutive hours riding in the subway! Just remember that if you leave the subway and re-enter, you will be charged a second fare.\n\n- Additionally, if you board a local bus and pay the $2.90 fare with a MetroCard, you can transfer to an express bus for the reduced price of $4.10 (instead of the standard $7 express bus fare).\n\n**Unlimited Ride MetroCards**– are available in 7-day ($33) and 30-day ($127). They are valid from the time you first use them until midnight of the 7th and 30th day, respectively. Do the math; these cards may work out to be cheaper if you plan on using public transport frequently during your stay. For example, the 7-day pass is worth it if you take at least 12 rides. It works out to roughly two trips every day for a week, so those who commute round-trip within the city every day for one week can benefit from this. Unlimited Ride MetroCards may not be used in rapid succession at the same subway station or on the same bus route. Once used, 18 minutes must elapse before it can be used at the same station (or on the same bus route). This is to prevent a group of people from sharing a single Unlimited Ride MetroCard. Hence, each member of the group will require their own Unlimited Ride MetroCard. Unlimited Ride MetroCards are NOT valid on express buses, JFK AirTrain, or PATH trains to New Jersey. If you are arriving at JFK Airport and take the AirTrain, the machines at the station do not sell Unlimited Ride cards. You should pay for the AirTrain ($5) and buy an unlimited card at the subway station.**7-Day Express Bus Plus**– costs $62 and allows unlimited use of not just local buses and subways, but also express buses. If you are staying in Staten Island, Queens, or Westchester county and plan to commute to the city during your visit, this pass may be advantageous to you.- Also available are two passes good only for unlimited use of the\n*JFK AirTrain*: a 30-day unlimited AirTrain pass for $40, and a 10-trip pass for $25. **Reduced fares**(50% off) for either MetroCard or OMNY are available for those 65 and over or those with a covered disability. They can be attained via online or mail application ahead of time, visiting the MTA's main customer service office at 3 Stone Street at the southern tip of Manhattan near Battery Park, or (for temporary cards of one month) at a Customer Service Center at one of fifteen NYC Subway stations across the system (see list here). Photo ID proof is required.\n\nYou can also get discounted tickets to certain events by showing your MetroCard when purchasing tickets. Current promotions are listed on the MetroCard website[dead link]\n\n#### By subway\n\n[edit]Despite a reputation for being dirty, the subway, which operates 24 hours a day 7 days a week, is the fastest and best way to travel around four boroughs of the city. Unfortunately for people who live there, it doesn't reach Staten Island, which is instead served by a separate railway. Fares are $2.90 (unless you use Single Ride MetroCard, which is $3), regardless of distance traveled. The much-feared subway crimes of the 1970s and 1980s are for the most part a thing of the past, and it is usually completely safe. Just remember to use common sense when traveling late at night alone. Try to use heavily-traveled stations, remain visible to other people, and don't display items of value publicly. While violent crime is rare, petty crime - especially theft of iPhones and other expensive electronics - is very frequent, so be aware when using your phone on the train.\n\n**Overhead signage**next to each track indicates the trains that stop at that particular track and the direction they are heading. In addition, the trains are marked by signage that indicates their route. Subway stations are ventilated to the street, so they can be quite cold in the winter. In summertime, the stations can be much warmer than the outside temperature. The trains themselves are air-conditioned and usually quite comfortable, but keep the temperature of stations in mind when planning your trip.- Some stations, especially local-only ones, have\n**entrances**which provide access to trains headed in one direction, not both. Read the signage outside the entrance to know which direction the train heads toward. If it heads in the opposite direction of where you need to go, enter across the street. - Some trains are\n**express**, meaning that they skip local stations to provide faster service. Wherever there is an express train, there is also a**local**train that makes all stops. Local and express trains often use different tracks, so be sure to board the correct train For example, the 2 and 3 are the express trains for the Broadway–7th Avenue Line between 96th Street and Chambers Street in Manhattan, while the 1 runs local alongside them. Some express trains run local or do not run at all late at night, and there are some lines in which there is an express train only during rush hours, in one direction. These trains either use a diamond-shaped icon instead of a circle-shaped one or are the Z train. - During weekends and late nights, certain trains do not operate or operate on a\n**limited schedule or route**, many express trains make local stops, and some subway entrances are closed. Detailed information is available on the MTA website. Additionally, maintenance work is usually concentrated on weekends and overnight. Notices of maintenance are posted at stations and on the MTA website[dead link], so check online to avoid unpleasant surprises. Remember, if you do feel confused, ask for help. Construction-related service changes confuse many New Yorkers, so the best person to ask is a subway employee. The entire subway system is massive and interconnected, so do not fear — there will almost always be another way to get to your destination without spending hours on the train. - A free\n**subway map**can be found online, or obtained at staffed station booths. Station agents can also assist you with directions, although agents may not always be easy to find. Free bus system maps for each borough, which are also available on the MTA website and from most bus drivers and some subway station booths, double as fairly good street maps that show the exact location of every subway station. Additionally, for convenience, subway maps are displayed in every station and on every train. Some stations also have touchscreen information panels that feature route planners. - If you accidentally skip your destination,\n*don't panic*. Get off at the next station and*do not go out onto the street*to try to get to the opposite platform. Doing so will not count as a transfer and you will be charged for the MetroCard swipe. Instead, navigate underground to get to the other platform, following the signs. As mentioned above, some stations do not have passage between the platforms; in this case, ask a subway employee which station ahead does let you cross over, wait for the next train there, then cross over. Tell them which station you are trying to get to, because they may suggest a different subway line that can get you there faster; since you are coming back, it does not matter which line you take if you transfer back to your original line. - If you see an empty car despite the fact that the rest of the train is crowded, you should avoid riding in that car. This usually means that there is a strong bad smell in that car.\n- If you don't feel completely safe, such as if you are traveling very late at night, look for the\n**black-and-white striped bar**mounted on the wall or hanging from the ceiling of the station which marks the location of the conductor's car, and board there. Generally, every car will be equally safe, but you may feel better with another pair of eyes nearby.\n\n##### Route overview\n\n[edit]Subway lines are not referred to by color. Instead, each route is identified by either a letter or a number; the color refers to the set of tracks used by the route, and older New Yorkers in particular also often identify routes by the line they travel on, as shown below. It is possible for a service to be diverted to a different route, especially during weekends and maintainance periods. Numbered routes use narrower train cars than lettered routes.\n\n- The Seventh Avenue Line ( 1 2 3 ) serves Broadway above 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue below 42nd Street, and is useful to get to the West Village, Chelsea, and Tribeca neighborhoods as well as the Staten Island or Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty ferries (1 to South Ferry station) and Columbia University (1 to 116th Street station). In Manhattan, the 1 train is local, while the 2 and 3 trains are express. Late nights, all routes may run local.\n- The Lexington Avenue Line trains ( 4 5 6 6 ) were essentially the only trains on the East Side above 23 Street until the construction of the Q Second Avenue Subway (see below). Useful to get to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (4, 5, or 6 to 86th Street station or 6 to 77th Street station), Guggenheim Museum (4, 5, or 6 to 86th Street station), and other East Side museums. Also useful to get to the Statue of Liberty (4 or 5 to Bowling Green station), Chinatown (6 to Canal Street station), and the Stock Exchange (4 or 5 to Wall Street station). The 4 also runs uptown through Spanish Harlem to 161 Street–Yankee Stadium and other destinations in the Bronx. In Manhattan, the 4 and 5 trains are express, and the 6 train is local.\n- The Flushing Line ( 7 7 ), dubbed the \"International Express\", runs crosstown along 42nd Street (making a good late-night alternative to the upstairs Shuttle – see below) and out to Queens, making stops in Filipino, South Asian, Hispanic, and Chinese/Korean neighborhoods. The penultimate stop on the line serves Citi Field and the USTA Billie Jean King Tennis Center. The 7 train is local, as it is the only route that operates on that line; however, it does offer express service during rush hours, toward Manhattan in the morning and toward Flushing in the afternoon.\n- The Eighth Avenue Line ( A C E ) serves Eighth Avenue/Central Park West between 14th and 116th Streets, then St. Nicholas Av., Broadway, and Ft. Washington Av. starting at 125th St. in Harlem. Between 50th and 59th streets, the E branches off to Queens, and the B and D trains join the A and C trains for the journey uptown along Central Park West (the B and C make local stops). This section is useful to get to the Museum of Natural History (B or C to 81st Street station), and the Cloisters Museum (A to 190th Street station). Take an uptown E train or Rockaway-bound downtown A train for access to JFK Airport. In Manhattan, except late nights, 'the A train is express, while the C and E trains are local.However, the E is the fastest express train in Queens, very useful for access to Jamaica and JFK if you are coming from Midtown.\n- The Sixth Avenue Line ( B D F F M ) runs on 6th Avenue from West 4th Street to 47th–50th Streets, and is useful for accessing the New York Public Library Main Branch (42nd Street station), Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and St. Patrick's Cathedral (47th–50th Sts. station). In Manhattan, the D is express, the B is local above 59th St., and the F and M trains are local.\n- Going downtown below West 4th Street, these trains go on their own separate ways. The D goes down 4th Avenue in Brooklyn to Coney Island. The F goes to Coney Island on its own route. The B goes express in Brooklyn and ends at Brighton Beach alongside the Q train, which also goes to Coney Island. The M goes east alongside the Nassau Street line (see below), but then branches again up Myrtle Avenue to Middle Village in Queens.\n- Going uptown, the B and D trains branch west and join the A and C trains (see above). They branch again toward the Bronx after 145th Street (which is the way to get to the 161 St–Yankee Stadium stop). The M train branches east and joins the E along 53rd street for the Museum of Modern Art (5 Av/53 St station), then heads off to Queens. The F train makes one more 6th Avenue stop at 57th Street before turning east to become an express train in Queens, making a stop at Roosevelt Island and joining the E, M, and R trains.\n\n- The Nassau Street Line ( J Z ) starts at Broad Street and goes along Nassau Street in Lower Manhattan before making stops along Broadway and Fulton Street in Brooklyn (not Broadway in Manhattan) and terminating in the Jamaica area of Queens. It's useful if you are transferring from a train that doesn't serve Lower Manhattan, but also if you are going to parts of Brooklyn or Queens. The J train is local, and the Z train is a skip-stop train that only operates during rush hour.\n- The Broadway Line ( N Q R W ) runs down Broadway below 42nd Street and on Seventh Avenue and 59th Street above Times Square. The Broadway Line trains are useful for accessing Chinatown (Canal St), SoHo/NoHo (Prince St), NYU area (8th St), Union Square (14th St), the Empire State Building (34th St), Times Square (42nd St), Carnegie Hall (57th St–7th Av station), Central Park (57th St–7th Av and 5th Av/59th St stations) and the southern end of the Upper East Side (5th Av/59th St and Lexington Av/59th St stations). The Q train goes further uptown through the Upper East Side via the new Second Avenue Line, while the N and W trains head out to Astoria, Queens. The R also goes up past Astoria to Jackson Heights and beyond, and is joined by the W down through the Financial District and South Ferry (Whitehall St). Like the D and F trains, the N and Q trains also provide service to Coney Island via their own separate routes: The N goes solo, and the Q runs alongside the B (see above). In Manhattan, 'the N and Q trains are express and the R and W trains are local. However, the W train only operates on weekdays. The usually runs local late nights, and sometimes the Q does, too.\n- The Canarsie Line ( L ) is a local line that runs crosstown along 14th Street in Manhattan, then through Williamsburg and Bushwick and eventually to Canarsie in Brooklyn.\n- The Crosstown Line ( G ) is a local line that runs along most of Western Brooklyn and into Long Island City in Queens. At no point on its route does it stop in Manhattan.\n- There are three Shuttles () in the system. The 42nd Street Shuttle stops only at Times Square on the West Side and Grand Central Terminal on the East Side. The Franklin Avenue Shuttle in Brooklyn makes four stops – at Fulton Street (transfer to C), Park Place, Botanical Gardens (transfer to 2, 3, 4, and 5), and Prospect Park (transfer to B and Q). The Rockaway Park Shuttle connects with the A train at Broad Channel before branching off toward Beach–116th Street on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens.\n\n#### By PATH\n\n[edit]**PATH** (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) trains primarily provide commuter service between urban Northern New Jersey and Manhattan in two branches—one connecting the city of Newark with the World Trade Center and a branch connecting the smaller enclaves of Hoboken and Jersey City with the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. PATH trains *can* be used to travel within Manhattan along a segment running under Sixth Avenue, although realistically there's no reason to use this service unless the Sixth Avenue subway line ( B D F F M ) is severely delayed or disrupted. Manhattan PATH stations are cramped and dusty; expect extremely crowded conditions during rush hours. Unlimited Ride MetroCards *cannot* be used on the PATH. PATH also accepts the SmartLink Card (similar to the MetroCard, but the SmartLink Card cannot be used on the NYC subway), and accepts contactless payment directly using credit cards, smartphone taps, etc at the TAPP gates. Like the subway, PATH operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. PATH trains usually arrive every 5–10 minutes (based on the time of day), but overnight, they may only come every 35 minutes.\n\n#### By the Staten Island Railway\n\n[edit]The **Staten Island Railway**, true to its name, is a railway line that serves Staten Island. It is owned and operated by the MTA. It is free *except* at the Tompkinsville and St. George stations. There, the price is the same as the subway ($2.90), and is payable by MetroCard (free transfers from MTA buses work, just as is the case with subways). SIR departure times from the terminal at St. George are usually coordinated with those of the Staten Island Ferry. The SIR consists of one line that travels along the East Shore of Staten Island, ending at Tottenville. A full timetable with other information can be found here[dead link].\n\n#### By commuter rail\n\n[edit]Commuter rail lines are mostly used for traveling between the city and its suburbs, owing to the vast existence of the Subway; however, they can be used for intracity transit as well. A handful of destinations are closer to commuter rail stops but far from the subway. MetroCards are *not* accepted on commuter rail; separate single or period tickets *must* be bought. When purchasing commuter railroad tickets, it is advantageous to purchase them online or in railroad stations prior to boarding. While tickets are available for sale on trains, there is an on-board surcharge that makes them significantly more expensive.\n\nThe **Long Island Rail Road**, often called the **LIRR** runs from Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, Atlantic Terminal in Downtown Brooklyn, and has limited rush hour service to Long Island City, Queens. The Port Washington Branch goes to Northeast Queens which, aside from Flushing and Citi Field, is not served by the subway system. The Main Line, which contains most of the branches to the different parts of Long Island, goes to Southeastern Queens, including Jamaica, Laurelton, and Rosedale. The Atlantic Branch, which ends in Downtown Brooklyn, goes to East New York and Bedford-Stuyvesant, both in Brooklyn. This branch is not accessible from Manhattan, however. The LIRR is also the fastest way to get from JFK to Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens, and also runs to many popular getaways in Long Island, such as Long Beach, Port Jefferson, and Montauk. The LIRR has a somewhat deserved reputation for poor on-time performance, however this is more of a problem in the farther eastern reaches of the railroad and not so much a problem in New York City and its immediate suburbs.\n\nThe **Metro-North Railroad** provides services from Grand Central Terminal. Trains go to the Bronx and the northern suburbs of the city. The Hudson Line covers several parts of the Western Bronx, while the Harlem Line goes through the Central Bronx — an area with no subway service. It is the best way to get to Arthur Avenue and the New York Botanic Gardens. The Hudson and Harlem Lines are also your gateway to Westchester County and beyond, with the Hudson Line running all the way to Poughkeepsie. The New Haven Line runs to Connecticut, terminating, logically enough, in New Haven.\n\nHowever, the other commuter railroad, **NJ Transit Rail Operations** only operates between Penn Station or places like Newark and Hoboken (both in New Jersey) to other points in New Jersey. Hence the name, NJ Transit.\n\n#### By bus\n\n[edit]Even in Manhattan, with its dense subway network, buses can often be the best way of making a crosstown (i.e. east-west) journey — for example, crossing Central Park to go from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Museum of Natural History. And outside peak hours, a ride by bus from the tip of Lower Manhattan at Battery Park to Midtown is a good and cheap way of taking in the sights.\n\n##### Bus basics\n\n[edit]- Bus lines are identified by letters followed by numbers. The letters indicate the borough in which the line mostly operates (M=Manhattan; Bx=Bronx; B=Brooklyn; Q=Queens; S=Staten Island). Collectively, the letters and numbers make up the route (examples: M31, Bx9, M15). Signage at each bus stop indicates which buses stop there. Signage on the front of each bus indicates the route and destination of the bus. Bus maps for each borough can be found at the MTA website.\n- Express buses travel between Manhattan and the outer boroughs, usually to areas where the subway doesn't operate (such as eastern Queens, the eastern Bronx, southeast Brooklyn, and Staten Island). They cost $6.75 but offer comfortable cloth seats and Wi-Fi, and are less crowded than the subway and local buses. Most express buses are identified by the borough they connect to Manhattan. Therefore, express buses to and from the Bronx would be labeled BxM (\n__Bx__for the__B__ron__x__,__M__for__M__anhattan; BxM11, BxM18), to and from Brooklyn BM (BM1, BM2), to and from Queens QM (QM1, QM2), and to and from Staten Island SIM (SIM1, SIM2). A few Brooklyn and Queens express buses are labeled with X (X27, X64). Express buses have a slightly different appearance than normal buses, with only one entrance/exit in the front of the bus. - The times posted on bus stops are often very unreliable, and may have nothing to do with the times the buses actually arrive. You can check the positions of the buses and their distance from a given stop online using MTA Bus Time. Each stop also has a QR code, with a link to that stop's entry.\n- At night, there is a much longer wait time between buses. If you anticipate riding the bus at night, plan an alternate route, probably via subway or taxi.\n- When boarding a bus with a MetroCard, insert the card vertically, with the pin hole down, the black stripe to the right, and the word \"MetroCard\" facing towards you, into the card slot in the top of the fare box next to the driver. You should be able to read the word \"MetroCard\" from bottom to top when inserting the card in this manner. The fare box will swallow the card, read it, and return it to you. This is different from the procedure to enter the subway described in Subway Basics.\n- Bus fareboxes also accept coins. However, they will not accept pennies, half dollar (50-cent) coins, or bills. As a safety precaution, drivers do not handle money. Change is not given, so exact fares must be paid. If you pay with coins and require a free transfer, you will have to ask the driver for one after you have paid.\n- Certain buses contain a small orange and purple card in the window that says \"Limited.\" These limited buses do not make all local bus stops, stopping only at major cross streets. They are similar to express buses in some ways, but only cost the standard $2.90 to ride. If a Limited bus skips your stop, you can wait for a local bus which will arrive soon. On some avenues served by multiple bus routes, some buses may operate Limited on the entire avenue or at least until they branch off. For example, with the M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5, the M2 and M5 provide limited-stop service on 5th Ave & Madison Ave during the day.\n\n**Select Bus Service (SBS)**routes also make limited stops and cost the standard $2.90 fare. These include the M14A, M14D, M15, M23, M34, M34A, M79, and M86 in Manhattan, the M60 in Manhattan and Queens, and several more routes in the outer boroughs. SBS routes can be identified by a special blue wrap around the lower half of the bus.*However, these buses operate on a very different payment system*. To board these SBS buses,*fares must be paid before boarding*using machines on the sidewalk at a special SBS bus stop, which is typically quite close to the local bus stop. Follow the instructions at the machine to pay. Once the fare has been paid, a receipt will be printed;*take it and keep it with you*. If you have an unlimited (daily, weekly, monthly) metro card, you can use it to get a ticket at no cost. You may also use OMNY to pay SBS fares by entering the bus through any door and tapping the reader. Once the bus arrives, you can enter through any door, but if you paid with cash, remember to use the front door if you need to ask the driver for a transfer. Fare inspectors will occasionally check for your fare receipt as proof of payment; show it to them if they ask. If you don't have a valid receipt, you will be forced to pay a fine of up to $100, so it is wise to always pay the fare. However, if you cannot buy the ticket successfully, such as due to a malfunctioning machine, note the machine number and report the problem to the bus driver near the front door at once. If the SBS skips your stop, wait at a local bus stop for a local bus.**Transfers**bus-to-bus, bus-to-subway, subway-to-bus transfers are automatic with metrocard payments within two hours of a swipe (i.e., within two hours of entering the subway or boarding a bus). If paying with coins on a bus, ask the driver for a bus-to-bus transfer (a single use metrocard). Transfers to and from the subway to a bus are not available if you pay cash or use a single use metrocard.\n\n### By taxi\n\n[edit]Taxis are widely available in New York, but due to surface traffic, it is often quicker to take the subway — or in Midtown Manhattan, to walk.\n\n**Yellow Cabs**cruise in most of Manhattan and are available at dispatcher lines at airports, but are harder to find in the other four boroughs. Real NYC taxis are yellow, have a metal seal on the hood (\"medallion\"), a light with a taxi number on the roof, a meter for billing, stickers on the windshield for various licenses, special taxi license plates, and a divider inside the car. The fares are $2.50 plus a $0.50 state tax to start, plus $0.40 for each 1/5 mile traveled. There is a night surcharge from 8PM to 6AM of $0.50 and a rush hour surcharge of $1 M-F 4-8PM. In addition, as in the rest of the United States, tipping your taxi driver is expected in New York. For more information, see Tipping in the United States. Info on fares, flat fares, group rides and rules are online. All yellow cabs accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express for payment. In the unlikely event that the card reader is broken, the driver will let you know before you get into the taxi. To hail a taxi, stand visibly near the street (but away from moving traffic) with one arm raised over your head. The medallion numbers on the roof of the taxi will indicate the status of the taxi:- If the medallion number is unlit, then the taxi is already occupied or otherwise unavailable.\n- If the medallion number is lit, then the taxi is available for hire.\n\n\n**Borough Taxis**were introduced in 2013 to address the shortage of yellow cabs outside Manhattan. Unlike yellow cabs, they are light green and have no medallions on the hood. These cabs are barred from picking up passengers in Manhattan south of West 110th St or East 96th St and may not enter the airport dispatcher lines. They can, however, pick up passengers in northern Manhattan and the other boroughs, and can drop off passengers anywhere. Fares and rules are otherwise identical to yellow cabs.**Livery or Black Cars**, known as car services or livery cabs, may only be called by phone, and are flat rate rather than metered. In most areas, they are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares, although sometimes they will do so anyway. Ask for the fare while on the phone. Their license plates will say either \"Livery\" or \"TLC\" on the bottom.**Ride Hailing Smartphone App Services,**such as Uber, Lyft and Via are extremely popular. Many drivers of black livery cars also use them to secure passengers when their own dispatchers are idle, so it's often possible to get a car from them in under ten minutes even in outer neighborhoods. Beware that most such services use variable-rate (aka \"surge\") pricing, and even small local increases in demand such as a concert letting out can trigger a 1.5x to 3x fare increase: always provide a destination address when hailing a car via an app, and examine the estimated fare carefully! Using these apps requires a smartphone with a working data connection (potentially expensive if you are roaming on an international account), and a credit card which you have entered into the app: you cannot pay the fare in cash.\n\nIn some areas, livery cabs can be flagged on the street. Though this is not legal (the driver, not you, could get into trouble), it is useful in upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs and is accepted practice, though this has mostly been replaced by the Borough Taxis and ride hailing apps. The minimum fare in these cabs is about $7, and it is advisable to negotiate the fare before you get inside (again, tipping your driver is expected). Since yellow cabs are hard to come by in the outer boroughs, these cars are particularly useful for getting to the airport (your hotel can arrange one, or look up car services in the Yellow Pages).\n\n#### Taxi basics\n\n[edit]- All licensed taxis (yellow for in Manhattan and Green for outside of Manhattan) and sedan limousines are authorized to take 3 passengers in the backseat and 1 in the front seat for a total of 4. However, some of the newer minivan and SUV yellow cabs can seat more passengers and may take more than four passengers (even though the licensed limit is posted in the cab). Larger than sedan limousines can be reserved, also useful for airport trips with lots of luggage, by calling any of the dozens of companies in the yellow pages.\n- Licensed taxis apply surcharges (in addition to the metered fare) depending on the time of day. From 6AM–4PM, the surcharge is $0.50; from 4–8PM, the surcharge is $1.50; from 8PM–6AM the surcharge is $1. For all cabs, you must pay tolls for bridges, tunnels and highways. Be careful of being overcharged by drivers for toll crossings—on some bridges and tunnels (like the Queens-Midtown Tunnel) rates are not posted in plain view. So, a crossing which actually cost the cab driver $4 is easily passed onto the unsuspecting passenger as a $5 charge. Outside the city, other than flat fare destinations (such as JFK Airport and Newark Airport), meter rates are doubled (when going to Westchester or Nassau County). Tipping your driver is expected. The customary amount is 15% of the total fare, or more if you need to transport luggage or are going to a remote area of the city (where the cab driver will have a difficult time getting a return passenger). If you chose to use the credit card machine that is found in most taxis (it doubles as a TV screen, the default tip will be 20% or 25% but you can adjust this if you resist feeling pressured and punch in the desired amount.\n- Be wary of unlicensed cars (known derisively as \"gypsy cabs\") cruising for passengers, especially near the airports or in areas not well served by yellow cabs. While drivers may claim to offer you a cheaper rate than an actual taxi, your chances of actually getting this rate (not to mention getting to your destination safely and quickly) are slim. If you're willing to negotiate and know what you're doing, you might be okay, but you're better off asking an airport staffer for help finding a cab or cabstand. Major airports have taxi information cards for passengers. Always settle on a price before getting into the car.\n- There are also van and shuttle services in different parts of the city. You will have to ask where it is going and how much it costs. Usually, you will see people lining up and a van will appear and they will board. There are services between Chinatown and Queens (you won’t have to make any transfers if it goes where you need to go!), and also there are separate services in Brooklyn, and Queens. Many of these services are branded as \"Dollar Vans\" (actually costing $2.00), and follow major bus routes along major avenues in these boroughs and will drop you off and pick up at any corner along the avenue. Some are legal while most aren't and usually compete with each other for customers and may cut some other van drivers off. This is an accepted practice in these boroughs and at times are faster than MTA buses. The illegal vans may not have insurance so you ride at your own risk. Most drivers of these vans have heavy West Indian accents. Some may seem sketchy but for the most part are people just trying to make a living. They usually are helpful with directions. It is rare that incidents occur with them.\n- While there are pedicabs in New York, they are generally used more for entertainment than for transit and are priced accordingly. They are rare to nonexistent outside of midtown Manhattan. Fares are usually posted on the vehicle.\n- One may have heard of the NYPD using undercover taxis in policing. Despite concerns, these undercover taxis\n*do not*engage in taxi business.\n\n### By ferry\n\n[edit]- The\n**Staten Island Ferry**, runs from Battery Park in southern Manhattan to Staten Island. The ferry carries passengers and bicycles only, runs every 15-20 minutes during rush hours and every 30 minutes at most other times, and is free (so don't be fooled by con artists trying to sell \"advance tickets\"). Not only does the ferry provide a means of transport, but it offers an amazing view of the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor on its way. Even if you don't want to visit Staten Island, taking this trip is highly recommended. It is very popular with tourists. Ride on the starboard side of the ferry (right side facing the front) from Manhattan and the port side from Staten Island for the best views (to the west). If you want to take good photographs, try to get on the ferry as soon as the gates open and walk briskly to an open window (few windows are open to the air and will populate quickly). The Manhattan-to-Staten Island route passes slightly closer to the Statue of Liberty than the return route. For security reasons, all passengers must exit the ferry upon reaching the terminal. Passengers intending to make an immediate return trip must exit the ferry, walk through the terminal to the waiting area, then board the next departing ferry. While the Staten Island Ferry also used to carry vehicular traffic, it no longer has since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks for security reasons. **NYC Ferry**operates a network of ferries primarily along the East River connecting Manhattan with Queens, Brooklyn, The Bronx and Staten Island. There is also one route along the Hudson River connecting Midtown West with Staten Island. These ferries cost the same as a bus or subway at $2.75 per ride (30 day passes are also available), with free transfers between ferries for 90 minutes. Tickets are available for purchase from vending machines or through the NYC Ferry app. There is an extra $1 surcharge to bring a bike. Children under the height of 44 inches ride for free when accompanied by an adult.**New York Waterway**, operates ferries that connect the city with the New Jersey Hudson River Waterfront. One-way fares vary in price depending on the route. For example, the ferries from Hoboken, Lincoln Harbor and Port Imperial to Midtown cost $9.00 each way, with an additional surcharge for carrying a bike. Reduced fares are offered for children and seniors.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]| “ | No one in New York drove; there was too much traffic. | ” |\n—Philip J. Fry, |\n\n|\nCongestion pricing\nAs if you needed another reason to avoid driving into Manhattan, the MTA has plans to introduce a congestion pricing scheme which will charge motor vehicles for entering Manhattan below 60th Street via license plate scanners. Passenger vehicles would be charged $9 to enter the area between 9AM and 9PM (limited to once per day, so leaving and reentering the zone in the same day would not incur a second charge); larger vehicles would be charged up to $21.60. Taxis would be charged $0.75 per trip into the zone, while other for-hire vehicles such as for Uber will be charged $1.50 per trip. Entering the zone after 9PM would incur a 75% discount; entering the area via the tunnels which already charge tolls (Queens-Midtown, Brooklyn-Battery, Holland, Lincoln) would also see a reduction. The charge does not apply to vehicles that stay on the West Side Highway or FDR Drive. Vehicles without E-ZPass would incur a 50% surcharge. Lawsuits have been filed by various groups which oppose the plan for various reasons and seek a legal order to prevent its implementation. The plan had been set to take effect on June 30, 2024, but on June 5 New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announced an indefinite delay to the plan, preventing the MTA from implementing it as scheduled. Hochul lifted the pause in November and the MTA voted to reinstate the plan effective January 5, 2025. |\n\nA word of advice about driving in New York City: **don't**. A car is inadvisable — street parking is practically nonexistent near crowded areas and tourist attractions, and garage parking rates range from very expensive to plain extortion. Traffic is almost always congested, parking rules are confusing, and many drivers are infamously aggressive. Public transportation options are many, and are quicker, cheaper and more pleasant. That's why many New Yorkers, particularly in Manhattan, don't own cars. If you think of staying in a suburb and commuting to the city by car, better to do as the locals do. Drive to one of the commuter rail stations (see above) or ferry docks. Parking fees at the station, fare, and MetroCard combined are usually much cheaper than parking downtown. Many stations have secure parking areas; however, it’s wise to investigate beforehand. Some suburban stations limit their parking to local residents, with enforcement by license plate camera and aggressive ticketing of unregistered vehicles. In Staten Island, parking near the ferry terminal and using the ferry will save you money and time.\n\nIf you do choose to drive, a smartphone with GPS support and a mapping application with turn-by-turn directions and live traffic conditions support (such as Google Maps, Apple Maps or Waze) is invaluable: New York's eternal cycle of road, bridge and tunnel maintenance, not to mention the daily changes created by accidents, festivals and police activity mean that a published paper map may be catastrophically inaccurate, even if it's been published comparatively recently. Many rental cars may not have a USB power port and even those that do will not provide a charge cable: bringing your own car power adaptor is a must if you're renting.\n\nIn Queens, numbers identify not only avenues and streets, but also roads, places, crescents, and lanes, all of which might be near each other. Read the entire street sign. Outer borough highways are confusing and often narrowed to one lane, the potholes could trap an elephant, the signs are sometimes misleading, exits which should appear do not, and signs directing a highway approach drag you through miles of colorful neighborhood (in the wrong direction) before finally letting you onto the highway with a stop sign and a hand's width of merge space.\n\nTraffic in New York City roughly follows a hierarchy of precedence, which it is unwise to challenge. Fire engines, ambulances, and police cruisers are given priority, followed by other public service vehicles such as buses, road crews, and sanitation trucks. Beneath them are taxi cabs and delivery trucks. Below *those* are other cars. Driving a car with out-of-state license plates (save for perhaps Connecticut or New Jersey) will instantly mark you as an outsider, sometimes resulting in other drivers being more aggressive around you than they would with a local. Suffice it to say, driving in New York is not for the timid or emotionally fragile.\n\nHowever, driving can be an exciting adventure, particularly on the parkways, with their numerous twists and turns. (Just watch out for other drivers, as noted above.) Also, since buses don't serve some of the parkways, driving or taking a taxi might be a workable option for those. Nonetheless, try to use bicycles or walk on the pedestrian trails near those parkways, where they exist; trails are less harrowing and you'd probably enjoy the scenery better.\n\n#### Car rental\n\n[edit]The major car rental agencies have offices at all three airports as well as throughout the city. Smaller agencies are also well represented. Be warned that car rentals in New York are generally more expensive than elsewhere in the United States, especially on weekends, when the locals rent cars to get out of the city. Rentals may require a deposit of up to $500 if you do not have a credit card. New York state law caps rental car collision damage waiver at $9 per day ($15 per day for premium cars), which is quite a bit less than in most other states. At that price, it's not a bad idea to add it to your rental, even if you have another source of coverage. (For more on rental car insurance in New York, check out the New York Attorney General's page on the subject. http://www.ag.ny.gov/consumer-frauds/car-rental-tip-sheet) Unlike most other states in the U.S., New York state law requires rental companies to rent to anyone at least 18 years of age, but there are hefty fees for those under 25.\n\nCar-sharing services like Zipcar and Hertz 24/7 are very well represented.\n\n#### Gas stations\n\n[edit]Gas stations can be found along main streets in the outer boroughs, but are sparse in Manhattan where only a handful exist around the perimeter of the island and in neighborhoods north of Central Park. Avoid filling your gas tank on highways within city limits—these charge a lot more compared to neighborhood gas stations.\n\n#### Points of entry\n\n[edit]There are several points of entry/exit into the city from the New Jersey side: the Lincoln Tunnel (midtown/41st Street), the Holland Tunnel (downtown/Canal Street), and the George Washington Bridge (way uptown/178th Street) — all are accessible from the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). I-78 east will also feed directly into the Holland Tunnel (US-1/9 is also a popular route). I-80 east will terminate at an I-95 junction, the north route of which will lead directly to the George Washington Bridge. The bridge is also directly accessible from US-46 east. With all of these options, many commuters choose to listen to 24 hour traffic reports on AM stations 880 (every ten minutes on the 8s) and 1010 (every ten minutes on the 1s, also available on 92.3 FM) to find the least congested route at that time. Weekend traffic delays can easily exceed 60 minutes at some of the tunnels, so plan accordingly!\n\nThe Midtown Tunnel under the East River is convenient for Long Island travelers, as it becomes the Long Island Expressway. The Queensborough Bridge (aka The 59th Street Bridge) also crosses the East River into Queens, is toll-free, and lands near the mouth of the Midtown Tunnel but requires some automotive manipulation to get onto a highway. Other routes head north and east out of the Bronx, including Interstates 87 (north to Albany) and 95 (northeast to Boston) and the Henry Hudson Parkway, which is along the Hudson River.\n\n#### Toll charges\n\n[edit]When entering New York from New Jersey, as well as when driving across the Throgs Neck Bridge, Whitestone Bridge, Verazzano-Narrows Bridge, Triboro Bridge, Midtown Tunnel and Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel within New York City, you will incur tolls of up to $15, and associated traffic delays.\n\n#### Rush hour traffic\n\n[edit]Traveling at off-hours makes sense to avoid rush hour traffic, but highways and roads are still generally packed any time of day. The Cross Bronx Expressway, which is part of I-95 and leads to the George Washington Bridge, is almost always choked with traffic. The Long Island Expressway has heavy eastbound traffic between the morning and evening rushes. The Holland and Lincoln Tunnels are 10-minute waits on a good day. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) is notorious, and an accident on the Verazzano Bridge without shoulders can cause a backup all the way through the northern part of Staten Island into New Jersey. It is a good idea to check radio traffic reports, especially before crossing a bridge or tunnel. Three different stations have reports every 10 minutes around the clock: 880 AM (on the 8's), 1010 AM (on the 1's, also available on 92.3 FM), and 1130 AM (on the 5's).\n\nDriving cross-town (east-west) in Manhattan during rush hours is especially troublesome because the traffic lights are optimized to move traffic along the north-south roads. Your best bet is to avoid driving in Midtown Manhattan (between the 30s and 50s) whenever possible. If you do drive in Midtown Manhattan crosstown on weekdays, consider using \"Thru Streets\"—these streets restrict turns onto major avenues at certain intersections and may reduce delays. They are indicated with purple and white signs at intersections.\n\n#### Traveling with a commercial vehicle\n\n[edit]If you are traveling with a commercial vehicle (defined as any vehicle designed to transport property with two axles and six tires, or three or more axles) remember that commercial traffic is prohibited on many roadways throughout the city. Commercial traffic is permitted only on roadways designated as Through and Local Truck Routes. Commercial traffic is prohibited on all multiple-lane roadways designated as \"parkways\" (such as the Grand Central Parkway, Cross-Island Parkway, or Henry Hudson Parkway) with frequent low bridges. Unfortunately, the majority of fast-moving roadways are designated as parkways in New York City. Commercial traffic is also prohibited on the Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) Drive in Manhattan. Before traveling anywhere in New York City with a commercial vehicle, refer to the New York City Truck Route Map.\n\n#### Garage parking\n\n[edit]Parking in garages or outdoor lots is usually very expensive, costing as much as $40 per day in Manhattan, although cheap or free lot parking is available at some times at certain locations. Street parking can be free or much cheaper than garage or lot parking, but can be extremely hard to come by. In Manhattan, self-park (or \"park-and-lock\") is extremely rare. The overwhelming majority of parking facilities in Manhattan have mandatory valet parking, so you must set aside a few dollars for tips, and anticipate the time it will take for a valet to retrieve your vehicle. Self-park garages in Manhattan near major tourist attractions include the Battery Parking Garage in Lower Manhattan, Manhattan Plaza Parking in Midtown Manhattan, and the public parking garage underneath the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nIn the case of parallel parking on the street, \"bumping\" cars in front of and behind of you to get into and out of a parking spot (known to some as \"Braille Parking\") is common. If you choose to park on the street, don't be surprised if you find a few new scratches and scrapes on your bumper.\n\nAs a general rule, hotels in New York do not supply garage parking. The few that do will charge you handsomely for the privilege.\n\nThere are several websites and mobile apps that can help you find and book parking, including: ParkMe.com, SpotHero, ParkWhiz.com, BestParking.com, Parkopedia.com, IconParking.com, and ParkFast.com.\n\n#### Street parking: rules and penalties for violation\n\n[edit]- Check all parking signs carefully. Parking meters demand constant feeding, and are hungry late into the night in some areas. In some parts of Midtown Manhattan, there are pay-and-display meters which are only in effect from 6PM to midnight on weekdays and all day on weekends. In these areas, parking is prohibited during the workday, except for commercial trucks. It is a good idea to keep a roll of quarters in your car, as not all meters accept credit cards. Parking is permitted at broken or missing meters for the time posted on the signs. Parking is illegal at ALL bus stops and within 15 ft (4.6 m) of fire hydrants. Yellow lines on the curb have no legal meaning in NYC, so they cannot be relied upon to tell you if you are parked far enough from a hydrant. However, in most areas the seams in the sidewalk are roughly five feet apart, so leaving at least three \"squares\" of sidewalk between the hydrant and your bumper is a smart move. Many motorists simply pay garage fees to avoid the anxiety of finding a parking spot and the risks of expensive parking tickets.\n- New York has \"alternate side of the street\" parking rules, which may require street parkers to move their cars at different times of the day (such as early morning, or overnight in a few business districts) so that street sweepers can clean the roads. Alternate side rules are suspended on many obscure holidays, while parking meters and other weekday restrictions are only suspended on a few major holidays (not even on all Federal holidays). The current state of parking enforcement can always be found on the \"NYC 311\" service: dial 311 on any phone, visit their website or install the 311 application on your smartphone.\n- Trying to leave a car parked illegally for very long will often end with a $150 fine, and a vehicle illegally parked in an overcrowded place is very likely to be towed away and face a $300 fine. The New York Police Department operates the tow pounds.\n\n#### Important rules while driving\n\n[edit]- The speed limit throughout the city is 25 mph (as of November 7, 2014).\n- Unlike other places in the United States,\n**right turns on red are illegal**, except where otherwise posted. While some entrances to New York City have signs alerting motorists that it is illegal to turn on red, other drivers from out of town may not know this rule. - As in the rest of New York State, talking on a cell-phone (without a hands-free device) or texting while driving is illegal. Even if you do have a hands-free device, minimize your talking and prioritize driving.\n- There are red light cameras at 100 intersections in New York City. A camera will take a picture if you run a red light and a fine disputable on the web will be issued in 30 days. However, since the camera does not identify who is driving the vehicle, no points will be issued against your drivers' license.\n- Some bus lanes have video cameras. A camera will take a video if you drive illegally in the bus lane other than to turn right and a fine disputable on the web will be issued in 30 days.\n- If there is an emergency vehicle trying to get through with its siren blaring, pull over to the side and move forward as necessary. On many one-way streets (avenues in particular), the middle lane is designated as the \"FIRE LANE\" so that motorists can pull over to either side lane.\n- Some avenues and many streets have only one-way traffic. Thankfully, one-way streets generally alternate direction, so if your destination is down a one-way street going in the wrong direction, go another block and double-back. A handy mnemonic is \"Evens go East,\" meaning that, for the most part, streets (in Manhattan) with even numbers will head east, and vice-versa. The best gauge to determine a one way street's direction is to check the direction parked cars face.\n- Be wary of your surroundings when you park your car. While NYC is a safe city for its size, it's not necessarily safe for your car as well. Make it as unworthy to steal as possible.\n\n### By bicycle\n\n[edit]Using a bicycle in New York City is common among New Yorkers and tourists alike. Bike paths can be found in every borough of the city, in three forms: bike lanes (road lanes specifically for bicycles), shared lanes (lanes shared between cars and bicycles), and greenways (roads solely designated to bicycles and pedestrians). Greenways are highly recommended for those wishing to go on a recreational journey. The Manhattan Waterfront Greenway circles (almost) the whole of Manhattan, and protected bikeways exist on some major avenues. However, most destinations will require some street biking. A map of bike paths in New York City can be found here. Bike shops give out free maps provided by the City. They show bike routes and shops, and indicate the ones that offer rentals.\n\nThe city has a bike share program called **CitiBike**. The program has over 750 stations in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. A map can be found here. To access a bike install the app. You can also visit one of the locations and pay for a pass. A single ride costs $3.81 to unlock plus $0.18 per minute. Return your bike to a station (remember to place it securely in a dock–you will be further fined if the light on the dock does not turn green). CitiBike is good for short trips to a known destination and **not** recommended for using a bike for a prolonged period of time.\n\nCycling in Manhattan can often be quicker than taking the subway or a taxi, but it isn't for the fainthearted. The borough's tumultuous traffic makes biking difficult. Aggressive cab drivers, jaywalking pedestrians, potholes and debris on the roads create a cycling experience that might just as well have been taken from Dante's *Inferno*. If you do venture into the concrete jungle on a bike, make sure you wear a helmet and have sufficient experience in urban cycling.\n\nCycling in Brooklyn and The Bronx can be more rewarding, or not, depending on the neighborhood. There are few bike paths in Queens; however, the roads are bike-friendly for the most part.\n\nCycling is *not* recommended in Staten Island. Access is difficult, with the main way to get in being the Staten Island Ferry. There are only a handful of bike paths on the entire island, mostly on the south shore. This is unfortunate, as Staten Island has beautiful displays of nature in some of its parks, most of which are accessible only on foot or by bicycle. If you are looking for scenery, by all means, take your bike with you on the ferry, but do not rely on it for transportation on the street.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]Like most of the great world cities, New York has an abundance of great attractions—so many, that it would be impossible to list them all here. What follows is but a sampling of the most high-profile attractions in New York City; more detailed info can be found in the district pages.\n\nA general word of advice on sightseeing in New York: Tourists often spend their entire vacation in New York standing in line (or as New Yorkers say, \"on line\"). This is often unnecessary; there are usually alternatives. For example, one can choose to avoid the Empire State Building during the day (it is open, and much quieter, late, until 2AM), skip the Statue of Liberty in favor of the Staten Island Ferry, and stay away from the Guggenheim on Monday (it is one of the only museums open that day). Also, there is no reason to stand in line for a Broadway show if you already have a ticket with an assigned seat. If you prefer, get a drink nearby and come back closer to curtain time, when you can walk right in. The lines for bus tours can be absurd because tourists all seem to have exactly the same itinerary, which is get on a bus in the morning in Times Square, get off for the Statue of Liberty, and finish on the East Side in the afternoon. Why not go downtown in the morning, and save Midtown for the afternoon? You will thank yourself for avoiding the crowds. Also, understand that buses are the slowest way to go crosstown in Midtown Manhattan during peak hours, and taxis are not much better. You are often better off on foot. Additionally, New York rush hour (especially in Manhattan) puts much of the city in gridlock: all subway lines and roads will be much busier from 4:30PM to 6:30PM.\n\n### Passes\n\n[edit]A number of multi-attraction schemes give reduced prices and line-skipping privileges.\n\n- GoCity Pass. 2 passes are available from GoCity. The\n*Explorer*pass lets you can visit a set number of attractions, while the*All-Inclusive*pass which allows unlimited attractions for a set number of days. The Explorer pass cardholders have 30 days to use the card after visiting the first attraction; the All-Inclusive cardholders have the time-limit activate on the day of first use. Both passes allow holders to either print a paper-pass to scan, or to use an Android/iOS compatible phone app. Attractions include Top of the Rock Observation, Rockefeller Center Tour, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, Museum of Modern Art, NBC Studio Tour, movie tours, and cruises. Also included with the card are shopping, dining, and additional attraction discounts. The biggest attraction not included is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Their newsletter may offer significant sales. - New York Pass. Also from GoCity. Grants access to over 50 top attractions with line skipping privileges. Passes are available for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 10 days. You must obtain a ticket in each attraction. You can visit as many attractions as you want in the time period. Also includes a 140-page guide book, but is much better to organize your visits in advance on the internet. Prices are given as adult price/child (ages 4-12) price. 1 day: $134/$99; 2 day: $199/$159; 3 day: $274/$199; 4 day: $299/$224; 5 day: $339/$244; 7 day: $379/$259; 10 day: $469/$299.\n- New York CityPASS. Grants admission to 6 New York attractions within 9 days of first use for a much reduced rate. The attractions are the Empire State Building, the Metropolitan Museum of Art & same-day admission to The Cloisters, the American Museum of Natural History, Top of the Rock or the Guggenheim Museum, Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island Ferry or Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises, and the 9/11 Memorial & Museum or the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. $132 adult, $108 child ages 6–17.\n\n*See also the district pages for detailed information about attractions. Detail is gradually being moved from this page to the district pages.*\n\n### Landmarks\n\n[edit]Naturally, Manhattan possesses the lion's share of the landmarks that have saturated American popular culture. Starting in the Financial District, perhaps the most famous of these landmarks is easy to spot - the **Statue of Liberty**, a symbol of the nation standing atop a small island in the harbor, and perhaps also the most difficult attraction to access in terms of crowds and the long lines to see it. Visitors may climb all the way up to the crown inside the statue, but tickets are limited and should be reserved months in advance. Nearby **Ellis Island** preserves the site where millions of immigrants completed their journey to America. Within the Financial District itself, **Wall Street** acts as the heart of big business being the home of the **New York Stock Exchange**, although the narrow street also holds some historical attractions, namely **Federal Hall**, where George Washington was inaugurated as the first president of the United States. Furthermore, there is a large statue of a bull that tourists often take pictures with. Nearby, the National September 11 Memorial at the **World Trade Center Site** commemorates the victims of that fateful day, and its replacement, officially **One World Trade Center** but colloquially known as the **Freedom Tower**, is the tallest building in the country at 1,776 feet (representing the year which the United States of America was founded). Connecting the Financial District to Downtown Brooklyn, the **Brooklyn Bridge** offers fantastic views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn skylines.\n\nMoving north to Midtown, Manhattan's other major business district, you'll find some of New York's most famous landmarks. **Macy's Herald Square** is the flagship store of the nationwide chain, and perhaps the most famous department store in the country. The **Empire State Building** looms over Midtown, with the nearby **Chrysler Building** also dominating the landscape. Nearby is the headquarters of **United Nations** overlooking the East River and **Grand Central Terminal**, one of the busiest train stations in the world. Also nearby is the main branch of the **New York Public Library**, a beautiful building famous for its magnificent reading rooms and the lion statues outside the front door; and **Rockefeller Plaza**, home to NBC Studios, Radio City Music Hall, and (during the winter) the famous Christmas Tree and Skating Rink.\n\nStill in the Midtown area but just to the west, in the Theater District, is the tourist center of New York: **Times Square**, filled with bright, flashing video screens and LED signs running 24 hours a day. Just to the north is **Central Park**, with its lawns, trees and lakes popular for recreation and concerts.\n\nOut in Queens you can find the **Unisphere** in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, originally built as the centrepiece of the 1964 World's Fair.\n\n### Museums and galleries\n\n[edit]New York has some of the finest museums in the world, many of which are priced accordingly. In addition to the major museums, hundreds of small galleries are spread throughout the city, notably in neighborhoods like Chelsea and Williamsburg. Many galleries and museums in New York close on Mondays, so be sure to check hours before visiting. The following is just a list of highlights; see district pages for more listings.\n\n#### Arts and culture\n\n[edit]New York City is home to some of the finest art museums in the world, and in Manhattan, you'll find the grandest of them all. The **Metropolitan Museum of Art** in Central Park has vast holdings that represent a series of collections, each of which ranks in its category among the finest in the world. Within this single building you'll find perhaps the world's finest collection of American artwork, period rooms, thousands of European paintings including Rembrandts and Vermeers, the greatest collection of Egyptian art outside Cairo, one of the world's finest Islamic art collections, Asian art, European sculpture, medieval and Renaissance art, and antiquities from around the ancient world. Its collection is so vast that it would be impossible to see everything in a week. As if all that wasn't enough, the Met also operates **The Cloisters** in Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, which houses a collection of medieval art and incorporates elements from five medieval French cloisters and other monastic sites in southern France in its renowned gardens.\n\nNear the Metropolitan, in the Upper East Side, is the **Guggenheim Museum**. Although more famed for its architecture than the collection it hosts, the spiraling galleries are ideal for exhibiting art works. The nearby **Frick Collection** houses a smaller though well-regarded collection of paintings by the old masters. In Midtown, the **Museum of Modern Art** (MoMA) holds the most comprehensive collection of modern art in the world, and is so large as to require multiple visits to see all of the works on display, which include Van Gogh's Starry Night and Picasso's *Les Demoiselles d’Avignon*, as well as an extensive industrial design collection. Midtown is also home to the **Paley Center for Media**, a museum dedicated to television and radio, including a massive database of old shows. The **Whitney Museum of American Art**, with a collection of contemporary American art, can be found in the Meatpacking District.\n\nIn Brooklyn's Prospect Park, the **Brooklyn Museum of Art** is the city's second largest art museum with excellent collections of Egyptian art, Assyrian reliefs, 19th-century American art, and art from Africa and Oceania, among other things. Long Island City in Queens is home to a number of art museums, including the **PS1 Contemporary Art Center**, an affiliate of the Museum of Modern Art, and the **Museum of the Moving Image**, which showcases movies and the televisual arts.\n\n#### Science and technology\n\n[edit]In New York City, no museum holds a sway over children like the **American Museum of Natural History** in Manhattan's Upper West Side. Containing the Hayden Planetarium, incredible astronomy exhibits, animal dioramas, many rare and beautiful gems and mineral specimens, anthropology halls, and one of the largest collections of dinosaur skeletons in the world, this place offers plenty of stunning sights.\n\nNear Times Square in the Theater District, the **Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum** takes up a pier on the Hudson River, with the aircraft carrier *Intrepid* docked here and holding some incredible air and space craft, including a former British Airways Concorde.\n\nOver in the Flushing district of Queens, on the grounds of the former World's Fair, is the **New York Hall of Science**, which incorporates the Great Hall of the fair and now full of hands-on exhibits for kids to enjoy.\n\nAnother standout museum is the **New York Transit Museum** in an abandoned subway station in Downtown Brooklyn. The old subway cars are a real treat and the museum is *a must* if you're in New York with kids (and well-worth it even if you're not).\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, New York was a predominantly industrial city. While most factories have been torn down, some neighborhoods, such as SoHo and the Meatpacking District, remain as a heritage of manufacturing. See the American Industry Tour.\n\n### Neighborhoods\n\n[edit]Like all great cities, New York is made up of distinct neighborhoods, each of which has its own flavor. Many of the neighborhoods are popular with visitors, and all are best experienced on foot. See individual borough pages (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island) for a comprehensive listing of neighborhoods.\n\n### Parks\n\n[edit]Though the image many people have of New York is endless skyscrapers and packed sidewalks, the city also boasts numerous lovely parks, ranging from small squares to the 850-acre **Central Park**. There are worthwhile parks in every borough, more than enough to keep any visitor busy. These include **Fort Tryon Park** in Upper Manhattan, which boasts grand views of the New Jersey Palisades, the grand **Pelham Bay Park** in The Bronx, the popular **Prospect Park** in Brooklyn, the famous **Flushing Meadows Park** in Corona, Queens, site of the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament, and the wondrous **Greenbelt** in Staten Island, a collection of beautiful parks and protected forests unlike any other park in the city. New York City is also home to portions of the **Gateway National Recreation Area**. Almost any park is a great spot to rest, read, or just relax and watch the people streaming past. To find out more about New York City parks, go to the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation website and the guide pages for each borough. Except for special events, all NYC parks are closed 1AM–6AM. The exception to this rule is parks affiliated with schools, which are closed for the entire time the sun is down.\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]### Entertainment\n\n[edit]#### Theater and performing arts\n\n[edit]New York boasts an enormous number and variety of theatrical performances. Most of these are concentrated in Manhattan, particularly the Theater District around Times Square, where you'll find the major musicals and big-name dramatic works of Broadway. These are the most popular with visitors, with tickets for some shows running to $130 a seat, though discounters make cheaper seats available. And if you're in town in early June (and willing to spend a lot of money), it's possible to purchase tickets to the Tony Awards, Broadway's biggest award ceremony and the culmination of the theatrical season in the city. However, you can also find \"Off-Broadway\" shows (and even the dirt cheap and very small \"Off-Off-Broadway\" shows) throughout Manhattan that play to smaller audiences and are far less expensive. Playbill.com is a good resource for current and upcoming Broadway and Off-Broadway info and listings. See the Manhattan page for more detailed info on theater offerings.\n\nSome of New York's (and the world's) most high profile music and dance halls include the **Brooklyn Academy of Music** in Downtown Brooklyn, **Carnegie Hall** — the premier venue for classical music in the United States — in Manhattan's Theater District, **Radio City Music Hall** — home of the Rockettes — in Midtown, and **Lincoln Center** in the Upper West Side, home to the prestigious Chamber Music Society, the Metropolitan Opera (\"the Met\"), the New York City Ballet, and the New York Philharmonic. There are also numerous small companies putting on more idiosyncratic shows every night of the week.\n\n#### Film and television\n\n[edit]New York is one of the world's greatest film cities, home to a huge number of theaters playing independent and repertory programs. Many major US studio releases open earlier in New York than elsewhere (especially in the autumn) and can be found at the major cineplexes (AMC, United Artists, etc.) around the city. As with everything else in New York, movies are quite popular, and even relatively obscure films at unappealing times of the day can still be sold out. It's best to get tickets in advance whenever possible. As many films premiere in New York, you can often catch a moderated discussion with the director or cast after the show. Sometimes even repertory films will have post-screening discussions or parties. Check listings for details.\n\nIn addition to the many commercial multiplexes throughout the city, some of the more intriguing New York film options include the several theaters in Greenwich Village and the East Village which play independent and foreign releases, many of which are screened only in New York. The **Film Society at Lincoln Center** in the Upper West Side puts on a terrific repertory program and shows a wide variety of experimental and foreign films, and also hosts the prestigious New York Film Festival in October. Another major film festival is the **Tribeca Film Festival**, held each May and a prominent event in New York's film calendar. The **Museum of the Moving Image** in Long Island City in Queens puts on a terrific screening program, with films showing continuously throughout the day, while **MoMa** in Midtown Manhattan puts on a terrific repertory program (and compared to other New York movie theaters, tickets to films at MoMA are a steal).\n\nVirtually every major national television network has studios in Manhattan, particularly the Midtown area, and many well-known programs are open to viewers. **Rockefeller Center** is home to NBC Studios and its flagship shows, including *Saturday Night Live* and *Today*, and is open for tours. **Lincoln Square** boasts programming produced for ABC, such as *The View* and *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire*, at the network's West 66th Street facility. More examples of popular programs you can see in person can be found on the Manhattan page.\n\n#### Parades\n\n[edit]New York City hosts many parades, street festivals and outdoor pageants. The following are the most famous:\n\n**New York's Village Halloween Parade**. Each Halloween (October 31) at 7PM. This parade and street pageant attracts 2 million spectators and 50,000 costumed participants along Sixth Avenue between Spring Street and 21st Street. Anyone in a costume is welcome to march; those wishing to should show up between 6PM-9PM at Spring Street and 6th Avenue.**Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade**. The morning of each Thanksgiving on Central Park West, this parade attracts many spectators and is broadcast on nationwide television.**St. Patrick's Day Parade**. The largest St. Paddy's parade in the world! Route is up 5th Ave from 44th Street to 86th Street and lasts from 11AM to about 2:30. Celebrations in pubs citywide happen the rest of the day and night until the green beer runs out.**Labor Day (aka West Indian Day Parade or New York Caribbean Carnival)**.\n\nThe Labor Day Carnival, or West Indian Carnival, is an annual celebration held in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Its main event is the West Indian-American Day Parade, which attracts between one and three million spectators, who watch the parade on its route along Eastern Parkway.\n\n### Sports\n\n[edit]A number of professional and collegiate teams play in the New York metropolitan area.\n\n- The\n**New York Yankees**play Major League Baseball at**Yankee Stadium**in the Bronx (East 161st Street and River Avenue. Subway: 4, B, D to 161st Street-Yankee Stadium). One of the most storied and lucrative sports franchises in the world, the Yankees have won 27 World Series championships in all, and have had many of the greatest players in baseball history play for the team including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. The original Yankee Stadium (known as \"The House That Ruth Built\" in reference to baseball legend Babe Ruth), was replaced by the current, more modern incarnation of the ballpark in 2009. The former site of the stadium before its relocation across the road is now a park.\n\n**Citi Field**in Flushing Meadows (126th Street and Roosevelt Avenue. Subway: 7 to Mets-Willets Point) is home to the**New York Mets**, who play in the National League of Major League Baseball unlike the Yankees (who play in the American League). The history of the National League in New York dates back to the 1800s with two teams: the New York Giants (not to be confused with the NFL's New York Giants), and Brooklyn Dodgers. When both of these teams moved to California in 1958, New York was left without the National League until 1962, when the Mets were born. The Mets have won two World Series titles since their inception. Notably, Citi Field is known for the Home Run Apple that rises when the Mets score a home run. This feature dates back to 1980, when the apple was first installed at Citi Field's predecessor venue, Shea Stadium. Citi Field first opened in 2009, around the same time as the new Yankee Stadium's first game.- In addition to its many concerts and the annual Westminster Dog Show,\n**Madison Square Garden**hosts the**New York Knicks**of the NBA and**New York Rangers**of the NHL, plus annual postseason college basketball for the Big East Conference. It had been home to the New York Liberty of the WNBA through the 2017 season, but that team now shares Barclays Center with the Brooklyn Nets. (Pennsylvania Plaza. Subway: 1, 2, 3, A, C, E to 34th Street-Penn Station). Madison Square Garden advertises itself as \"The World's Most Famous Arena\", and it's easy to see why. - Long based in New Jersey, the\n**Brooklyn Nets**basketball team moved to**Barclays Center**in Brooklyn (Vanderbilt Yards. Subway: 2, 3, 4, 5, B, D, N, Q, R to Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center) when that arena opened in 2012. The aforementioned**New York Liberty**, now owned by the Nets' owner, moved to Barclays Center in 2021 (delayed from 2020 by COVID-19). - Other NHL teams are the\n**New York Islanders**and**New Jersey Devils**. The Islanders now play at**UBS Arena**in Elmont, just outside Queens and a little less than 20 miles east of Midtown (LIRR: Elmont), which opened in November 2021. Notably, the arena is next to the Belmont Park horse racing track.

(The exact timing is five weeks after the Kentucky Derby, a race that is always held on the first Saturday of May.) However, due to a complete reconstruction of the grandstands, the Belmont Stakes moved upstate to Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs for 2024 and 2025.\n\n## Learn\n\n[edit]New York City has a number of learning opportunities.\n\n**Columbia University**, a member of the Ivy League, is, without a doubt, the most prestigious university in the city. It is adjacent to and affiliated with **Barnard College**, a top women's school. **New York University** (**NYU**) is also highly selective. Another notable university is **Rockefeller University**, a graduate-only school at which several significant biomedical discoveries were made. And the city also has its very own system of public colleges, **City University of New York**, with every borough represented among its numerous branches.\n\n## Buy\n\n[edit]It is not a lie: New York City is one of the world's most expensive cities. One survey revealed that the city is the most expensive city in the world for expatriate workers.\n\nThat being said, there are ways to limit the damage; food is available from many halal food trucks for $7-10, which will get you rice with meat, vegetables and a soft drink, and you can still find inexpensive pizza slices at many of the hole-in-the-wall pizzerias throughout the city. Supermarkets and convenience stores generally also sell basic items at reasonable prices (by Western standards). New York's public bathroom infrastructure is lacking, so buying an item at a facility with a bathroom is generally advisable if you are far from your accommodation.\n\nNew York is the fashion capital of the United States, and is a major shopping destination for people around the world. The city boasts an unmatched range of department stores, boutiques, and specialty shops. Some neighborhoods boast more shopping options than most other American cities and have become famous as consumer destinations. Anything you could possibly want to buy can be found in New York, including clothing, cameras, computers and accessories, music, musical instruments, electronic equipment, art supplies, sporting goods, and all kinds of foodstuffs and kitchen appliances. See the **borough pages** and **district sub-pages** for listings of some of the more important stores and major business districts, of which there are several. New York state has a sales tax exemption on all clothing items that cost less than $100.\n\nThe popular place to begin is Manhattan, most notably Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, where the iconic flagship stores of many major department stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman[dead link] are located. Other notable department stores in Manhattan include the world-famous Macy's[dead link] at Herald Square, Bloomingdale's on 59th Street between 3rd and Lexington Avenues, and Nordstrom on Broadway at 57th Street. Of course, for dirt-cheap knockoffs, the various Chinatowns in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn respectively are the place to go.\n\nNew York City is not known for budget shopping, but during major sales, such as the Black Friday sale after Thanksgiving, prices of some out-of-season items have been known to be slashed by as much as 50%, meaning that it is possible to find good deals for genuine luxury brand-name items if you are there at the right time. Savvy New Yorkers shop after Christmas and especially after New Year's.\n\n### Buying art\n\n[edit]Anyone can freely create, display, and sell art, including paintings, prints, photographs, sculptures, DVDs, and CDs, based on freedom of speech rights. Thousands of artists earn their livings on New York's streets and parks. Common places to find street artists selling their work are SoHo, the Financial District and near the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n### Outlets\n\n[edit]New York City has a number of retail outlet locations, offering substantial discounts and the opportunity to purchase ends-of-line and factory seconds.\n\n### Convenience stores, pharmacies, and supermarkets\n\n[edit]Basic food, drinks, snacks, medicine, and toiletries can be found at decent prices at the ubiquitous **Duane Reade [dead link]** (owned by Walgreens),\n\n**CVS**, and\n\n**Rite Aid**stores. For a more authentically New York experience, stop by one of the thousands of bodegas/delis/groceries. Although some of these stores have a somewhat ramshackle appearance, they are reliable though often not the cheapest places to purchase groceries, water, flowers, coffee, and cooked food, typically 24/7.\n\nThere are several local and regional chains of supermarkets represented all over the city, including **Associated**, **C-Town**, **D'Agostino's**, **Foodtown**, **Gristedes** and **Key Food**, and **Fairway** and **West Side Market** have a few locations. There are also chains such as **Hong Kong Supermarket** and **H-Mart**, which cater primarily to Chinese and Korean customers, respectively. National chains selling food include **Trader Joe's**, **Whole Foods Market**, **Costco** (membership required; mostly in bulk) and **Target**.\n\n### Shopping in airports\n\n[edit]Most shops in New York-area airports are chain outlets, the same as can be found in most large airports in the world, so it's pretty difficult to feel the spirit of the fashion capital if you only have 2 hours waiting for a connecting flight. At JFK, JetBlue Airways' new Terminal 5 is populated with modern, cutting-edge restaurants and shops, but terminals 4 and 8 are also relatively good places for retail and duty-free shopping.\n\n### Street vendors\n\n[edit]In New York City it is common for street vendors to set up tables on the sidewalk, close to the curb, and sell items. They are required to obtain a permit to perform this activity, but it is legal. Purchasing from these vendors is generally legitimate, although buying brand name goods from them (particularly expensive clothing and movies) is generally ill-advised unless you want cheap imitation products. It is considered safe to buy less expensive goods from these vendors, but most will not accept payment by credit card, so you will have to bring cash. Be particularly wary of any street vendor that does not sell from a table (especially vendors who approach you with their merchandise in a briefcase), as these goods are almost certainly cheap imitation products.\n\n## Eat\n\n[edit]New York has, as you might expect of the Big Apple, all the eating options covered and you can find almost every type of food available and every cuisine of the world represented. There are literally tens of thousands of restaurants, ranging from dingy cheap pizza-by-the-slice joints to $500-a-plate *prix fixe* sushi. Thousands of delis, bodegas, and grocery stores dot every corner of the city and do it yourself meals are easy and cheap to find. Street food comes in various tastes, ranging from the ubiquitous New York hot dog vendors to the many Middle Eastern carts at street corners in Midtown. Fast food is as plentiful and as diverse as you can imagine. Fruit stalls appear at many intersections from spring to fall with ready-to-eat strawberries, bananas, apples, etc. available at very low cost. Vegetarian and vegan options abound throughout the city.\n\n### Don't leave without trying\n\n[edit]#### New York pizza\n\n[edit]A peculiarly New York thing, a true New York pizza is a plain cheese pizza with a very thin crust (sometimes chewy, sometimes crisp), and an artery-hardening sheen of grease on top. From just about any pizzeria, you can get a whole pie with a variety of toppings available, or a \"dollar slice\" if you just want a piece of plain cheese pizza. The \"dollar slice\" cost $1 at the start of the 21st century, but prices have risen, and it may cost anywhere between $1.50 and $4 before sales tax, depending on the place and any toppings you want. Just fold in half lengthwise, grab a lot of napkins, and eat – the quintessential meal on the go in New York. Dollar-slice places can be found all over the city, and include the many different variations of \"Ray's Pizza\", all of which claim to be the original thing. However, perhaps the most respected of the corner joints is the wildly popular **Joe's** in Greenwich Village.\n\nBut while pizza in New York is generally considered a fast food, the most respected pizzerias in the city are those that act like sit-down restaurants, and some of them serve whole pies only, no slices. Except for DiFara's, all the following pizzerias use a classic New York style of coal-fired, rather than gas-fired ovens, which allows them to bake their pizza for a very short time at very high temperatures, producing a unique style of crispy, slightly charred crust that makes their output quite different from the average corner slice shop. Every New Yorker has their own personal favorite, but several routinely make it to the top of the list. **Lombardi's** in Little Italy is regarded as the oldest pizzeria in town and continues to draw in big crowds of tourists, but **Patsy's** in East Harlem has long been regarded by connoisseurs as serving perhaps the purest example of plain New York-style coal-oven pizza (don't order any toppings, though). Greenwich Village is the center of pizza on Manhattan, home to not only Joe's but also the classic **John's** and the popular **Arturo's**. In Brooklyn, **Grimaldi's** in DUMBO is hugely popular with lines that go down the street, while **Totonno's** on Coney Island and **Di Fara's** in Midwood remain mainstays with the locals. There are also excellent brick-oven establishments serving Neapolitan or other styles of pizza that are not classic New York but well worth having.\n\n#### New York hot dog\n\n[edit]Nothing represents New York street food like the almighty hot dog. Affectionately called \"dirty water dogs\" by the locals, a New York hot dog is typically all-beef, served in a plain bun, and topped with mustard, ketchup, relish, or any combination of the three. You can get one from pushcarts on seemingly every street corner and park in the city. Just wrap the dog in a paper napkin and walk along the sidewalk trying not to let the toppings slip and slide all over your hands. And of course, both ballparks make sure to keep their fans' hot dog needs satisfied.\n\nHowever, there are a few places that go a step beyond the typical dirty water dog, with better cooked dogs and a much greater variety of toppings available. Many hot dog enthusiasts make the pilgrimage to the original hot dog stand, **Nathan's** on Coney Island, although locals generally view it as a tourist trap. In Manhattan, **Papaya King** (on the Upper East Side) and **Gray's Papaya** (on the Upper West Side) are favorites, so-named because they also serve tropical drinks with their frankfurters. In addition to their sandwiches, **Katz's** on the Lower East Side is also reputed for an excellent deli dog. In the East Village, **Crif Dogs** draws people in for their deep-fried, beef-and-pork (and often bacon-wrapped!) dogs. **Dominick's** food truck commands a fiercely loyal crowd, who flock to a quiet side of Queens to get a taste. People looking for a good bratwurst should try the **Hallo Berlin** cart on 54th and Fifth in Midtown, while Chicago purists should head to the **Shake Shack** in Madison Square Park.\n\n#### New York bagel\n\n[edit]There is no bagel like the New York bagel anywhere else in the world. Bagels are a doughnut-shaped round of boiled dough that is then baked until it has a distinctive, chewy, sweet interior and a leathery outer crust. They arrived from the Old World with Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe and have become utterly New York in character. You can get bagels anywhere in the city, but for the best bagels you may have to trek away from the main tourist sites. The key point, though, is get them when they are hot (and that does not mean reheated in the microwave). Some places actively discourage toasting; try them fresh out of the oven. Good bagel shops will offer a variety of cream cheese spreads and sandwich stuffings, like lox, salmon, tofu spreads, onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Many bagel shops are extremely generous with their cream cheese; locals will order \"just a schmear\" to get a more reasonable amount.\n\nOn Manhattan, many people swear by **Ess'a Bagel** in Midtown, with their giant bagels and huge variety of toppings, although bagel purists respect **Murray's** in Greenwich Village and Chelsea for their refusal to allow toasting. Other places in Manhattan which command fiercely loyal followings are **Brooklyn Bagel**, also in Chelsea, and **Absolute Bagels** on the Upper West Side. In Brooklyn, **Bagel Hole** in Park Slope is a no-frills place with smaller bagels, and is often ranked as one of the top bagels in the city, while over in a quiet section of Queens, **Bagel Oasis** is regularly considered among the very best.\n\n#### New York pastrami sandwich\n\n[edit]Another delicacy brought over by Jewish immigrants, pastrami sandwiches are another specialty of New York City. A \"Reuben\", a grilled sandwich piled high with corned beef, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing and sauerkraut between two slices of rye bread, is always a good choice, though it is not kosher as it violates the Jewish prohibition on mixing meat and dairy. A good deli sandwich doesn't come cheap: be prepared to spend upwards of $20 for a good sandwich, due to the fact that these meats are prepared using natural methods now outmoded by artificial flavorings and mass production. Many delis also serve other Jewish specialties, such as matzo ball soup.\n\nIf you want pastrami, your best bet is **Katz's Delicatessen**, an institution on the Lower East Side that's been serving up excellent sandwiches for over a century. **2nd Ave Deli** in Murray Hill is a famous kosher deli that's a real throwback to the Jewish delis of old. And if you find yourself over in East Brooklyn, **Mill Basin Deli** is known for some of the best pastrami in Brooklyn. In the Bronx, **Liebman's Deli** continues to hold the fort.\n\n#### New York desserts\n\n[edit]Another New York claim to fame is the **New York cheesecake**, which relies upon heavy cream, cream cheese, eggs and egg yolks to add a richness and a smooth consistency. It was made famous by **Junior's**, which still commands a loyal crowd with two locations in Midtown, although the original is in Downtown Brooklyn. Other favorites are **Eileen's** in NoLiTa, **Lady M** and **Two Little Red Hens** in the Upper East Side and **S&S** in the Bronx (whose cheesecake is also sold at Zabar's on the Upper West Side).\n\nAnother dessert of New York origin is the **egg cream**, also often referred to as a \"chocolate egg cream\", a blend of chocolate syrup, milk, and seltzer water (note the curious absence of either egg or cream). Though not often on the menu at many diners, many will still prepare one for you if you ask for one. You can also find them in surprising places, like the tiny Ray's Candy Store in the East Village.\n\n### Restaurants\n\n[edit]Maybe it's the size of New Yorkers' tiny kitchens, or perhaps it's the enormous melting-pot immigrant populations, but either way, this city excels at every kind of restaurant. There are fancy famous-chef restaurants, all ethnic cuisines and fusion/updates of ethnic cuisines (second-generation immigrants tweaking their family tradition), plus all the fashionable spots, casual bistros, lounges for drinking and noshing and more.\n\nIt's only a slight exaggeration to say that virtually every type of cuisine is available in New York. And in some neighborhoods you'll find many national and regional styles represented. However, certain neighborhoods, particularly those in Queens, really shine in terms of the sheer variety available to visitors. While Manhattan's high rents often result in expensive restaurants and sometimes watered-down, unnaturally sweetened food, Queens' vast array of cuisines are often served primarily to patrons from the countries where they originated. Not that Manhattan is completely bereft by any stretch, however: a wide variety of Chinese options can be found in Chinatown and the East Village, there's the small Koreatown with some very good (but not necessarily cheap) restaurants, Washington Heights is the center for Dominican food, the East Village is full of Japanese eateries of various types, and part of Murray Hill is known as \"Curry Hill\" for its proliferation of Indian restaurants. But in Queens, Flushing offers a vast and diverse array of Chinese (including Northeastern, Sichuan, Hunanese, Shanghainese, etc.), Korean, and Indian eateries; Jackson Heights includes a prominent Indian section among a vast Latin American neighborhood whose eateries span the American continents from Chilean to Mexican and almost everything in between; nearby Elmhurst features various Southeast Asian (for example Vietnamese and Thai, with a couple of Indonesian and Malaysian restaurants thrown in) and Chinese cuisines; Long Island City has locally well-known halal restaurants among a very diverse set of good establishments; nearby Astoria is best known for its Mediterranean food; and Rego Park has Uzbek dining halls. In Brooklyn, Brighton Beach is noted for its Russian eateries, while Sunset Park is home to a third Chinatown as well as plenty of Malaysian and Vietnamese options. Italian options can be found in virtually every neighborhood, although a higher number appear in Staten Island, the East Village, Greenwich Village, heavily Italian parts of Brooklyn like Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge, and the area around Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. (Italian restaurants in Manhattan's \"Little Italy\" are mostly for tourists only, and New Yorkers generally avoid Mulberry St. between Canal and Broome. Likewise, you would be hard pressed to find locals eating in the chain restaurants [including chain pizzerias] around Times Square.)\n\nDue to the higher cost of living, you are in general expected to tip more in New York City than in other parts of the U.S. As a general rule, tips should start at 18% of the cost of the meal for adequate service, and may go up to 25% for service that goes above and beyond what is expected.\n\n#### Dress codes\n\n[edit]Restaurants with entrees under $35 are unlikely to have any preference about what their customers wear. Of course, like most major cities, New York has some expensive, extremely fashionable restaurants that care about, and enforce, a certain level of dress among their customers - but \"jackets only\" restaurants are very uncommon nowadays to the point at which the restaurant's reputation would make the fact known.\n\nIf you're from elsewhere in the US and wish to \"pass\" as a local within Manhattan, pay attention to your shoes and coat. Most local exclusiveness is pretty understated, but where it exists it's generally to distinguish locals from nightlife commuters from New Jersey and Long Island that supposedly threaten to rob bar-filled neighborhoods of their local color. Therefore, if your style doesn't fit in but is obviously from outside the US, you may find yourself welcomed as graciously as any local, if not more so.\n\n### Vegetarians\n\n[edit]Vegetarians and vegans will find New York to be a paradise with hundreds of vegetarian-only restaurants and good veggie options in even the most expensive places. There are many vegetarian-only restaurants with offerings varying from macrobiotic food to Ayurvedic thalis or Asian Buddhist food. But, more importantly, almost every restaurant at every point on the price scale has vegetarian dishes that are more than an afterthought. Even **Per Se**, one of the most expensive and sought after restaurants in the city, has a seven course vegetarian tasting menu well worth the expense. DIY vegetarians will have no problem finding fresh vegetables, a wide variety of cheese, bread, and prepared vegetarian foods in New York supermarkets.\n\n### Street food\n\n[edit]Nothing differentiates New York more from other American (and European) cities than the astonishing amount of food cooked and served on the streets. Starting with the thousands of hot dog stands on almost every street corner, the possibilities are endless. People trek to Jackson Heights in Queens for a nibble of the famous arepas of the **Arepa Lady**. Freshly cooked Indian dosas are served up for a pittance at the **NY Dosas** stand in Washington Square Park. The **Trinipak** cart on 43rd and Sixth in Midtown serves delicious Trinidadian/Pakistani food. Danny Meyer, the famous restaurateur, runs the burger stand **Shake Shack** in Madison Square Park as well as several other locations throughout the city. The halal offerings in Midtown are legendary (**Kwik-Meal** on 45th and Sixth; **Halal Guys** on 53rd and Sixth and many others). Most carts serve lunch from about 11AM to 5 or 6PM in the evening and disappear after dark, so look for a cart near you, smell what's cooking, and enjoy a hot and often tasty lunch for a few dollars (a meal costs anywhere from about $2 to $8). Mornings, from about 6AM to 10AM, the streets are dotted with coffee carts that sell coffee, croissants, bagels, and Danish pastries and are good for a cheap breakfast: small coffee and bagel for a dollar or so. From 10AM to 7PM, many vendors sell lunch and dinner choices, including hot dogs, hamburgers, gyros, and halal. Other street vendors sell Italian ices, pretzels, ice cream, and roasted peanuts. Also, look around for the coffee truck (often found in Union Square), dessert truck, and the Belgian waffle truck that roam around the city.\n\n### Do it yourself\n\n[edit]New York's many markets and grocery stores make preparing your own food interesting and easy. Almost every grocery store, deli, or bodega has a prepared foods section where you can make your own salad (beware, you are charged by the pound!) or buy ready-to-eat foods such as burritos, tacos, curries and rice, lasagna, pastas, pre-made or freshly-made sandwiches, and many other types of foods. Any supermarket will have enough to take away to the park or your hotel room for a low-cost meal. **Whole Foods** has five New York City locations, all with a variety of foods and a clean place to sit and eat. **Zabar's** on the Upper West Side is very famous, with a huge selection of foodstuffs and expensive foods as well as cooking supplies. There is also a **Trader Joe's** at Union Square and in 6 other locations in every borough but the Bronx for cheap but delicious supermarket buys, and **Western Beef** supermarkets offer more foods from different ethnicities than average supermarkets.\n\nIf you have a place to cook, you'll find almost any kind of food in New York, though you may have to travel to the outer boroughs for ethnic ingredients. Most supermarkets have Thai, Chinese, and Indian sauces to add flavor to your pot; many, especially in Upper Manhattan, have the ingredients necessary for a Mexican or Central American meal; and there are several H-Mart supermarkets around town for Korean ingredients and prepared foods; but go to Chinatown for the best Chinese ingredients, Little India in Murray Hill for Indian ingredients, Flushing for all things Chinese or Korean, Jackson Heights for Peruvian, Ecuadorian, and South Asian, Flatbush and Crown Heights for Jamaican, Williamsburg for Kosher, and Greenpoint for Polish. Ask around for where you can get your favorite ethnic ingredients and you'll find traveling around in local neighborhoods a rewarding experience.\n\n## Drink\n\n[edit]**Last call** can be as late as 4AM, although many establishments will let you stay beyond that, especially in the outer boroughs. It is not uncommon to be locked in a bar after 4AM so people can keep drinking. Wine and liquor are sold at **liquor stores**, and are not sold at delis or supermarkets. Beer cannot be bought between 4AM and 8AM on Sunday morning (although if you look hard, you can get around this).\n\nAs in most American cities, drinking alcoholic beverages on the street is illegal. The law is flouted openly in many areas, but bars will not generally let you take your drink outside.\n\n### Popular nightlife neighborhoods\n\n[edit]The only thing about New York City that changes faster than the subway map or the restaurants is the bar scene. While some established watering holes have been around for decades or centuries, the hot spot of the moment may well have opened last week and could likely close just as quickly.\n\nOn Manhattan, **Greenwich Village** is probably the best neighborhood to go if you are in town for just a brief period, full of locals of all ages, especially students attending NYU. **Chelsea** has lots of clubs and a thriving gay scene, and if you are European and looking for a discothèque, this is where you want to be. The **Meatpacking District** holds trendier bars and clubs and some expensive restaurants. The **Lower East Side**, formerly the dingy alternative to the West Village, has become trendier today, with an influx of hipsters. The **East Village** also has lots of bars, as well as a sizeable cluster of Japanese bars. Nearby, **Alphabet City**, once a dangerous drug-addled hell hole, has since cleaned up and is loaded with bars. **Murray Hill** is more hip with the 30-year-old crowd, with many Indian restaurants and plenty of watering holes, including a couple of fireman bars and an all Irish whiskey pub. **Times Square** is a very touristy area with a few classy hotel rooftop bars, although very few New Yorkers would be caught dead at these places.\n\nIn Brooklyn, **Williamsburg** is the capital of NYC's hipster scene, and many of New York's small music venues are here. **Bay Ridge** has one of the highest concentrations of bars in the city in a neighborhood that has been generally Irish/Italian and does not have the hipster/yuppie scene common in New York. **Park Slope**, however, is the yuppie capital of New York and you are more likely to find a tea house serving soy milk than a bar here. There is some low-key nightlife, although this has been on the decline. A number of lesbian bars are in this area.\n\nQueens is home to **Woodside**, an Irish neighborhood great for happy hour and drinking festivities before a Mets baseball game. **Astoria** is home to Queens' Bohemian Hall Beer Garden, which covers an entire city block, is walled and filled with trees, indoor and outdoor tables and a cool crowd, and serves great Czech and German beer. And on Staten Island, **St. George** has a few bars located south of the ferry terminal, with good live music.\n\n### Jazz\n\n[edit]NYC has a pretty confident claim to be the world capital of jazz. It exerts a brain drain influence on the rest of the country's most talented jazz musicians, and the live music scene is simply thriving. This goes for all styles of jazz, (except pre-swing trad jazz, which safely belongs to New Orleans): Latin, modern, fusion, experimental, bebop, hard bop, you name it. **The Blue Note** in Greenwich Village is probably the most famous extant jazz club in the world, with nightly headliners and cover charges to match. The **Village Vanguard** is a legendary hole-in-the-wall (also in Greenwich Village), having played host to most of the greats going back to 1935. Other top (i.e., famous—there are fabulous lesser-known places to hear jazz throughout the city) clubs include **Birdland** in the Theater District and the **Cotton Club** in Harlem. If the high cover charges in this expensive city are giving you the blues, look at **Smalls** and **Cellar Dog**, which are within a block of each other in Greenwich Village and keep the covers as low as possible, so that musicians can actually afford to come!\n\n### Salsa\n\n[edit]Would it be too provocative to declare New York the home of salsa? Possibly, but there's a reason to consider it. Salsa originated in Cuba, but its second home was New York (especially the Bronx), where it truly exploded and developed into a global phenomenon, driven by innovations from Cuban and later Puerto Rican immigrants. Latin dance, particularly salsa (danced on the two) and other Afro-Caribbean varieties, remains enormously popular, although it's now centered more on a semi-professional ballroom-dancing crowd rather than Latino communities. The **Copacabana** near Times Square dates back to 1940, and is probably the city's best known Latin dance club. Other well known options include **Club Cache** also near Times Square, the very Dominican **El Morocco** in Spanish Harlem, and **Iguana** in west Midtown. Many venues in the city hold a salsa night once a week, so poke around the city papers for event listings.\n\n## Sleep\n\n[edit]### Hotels\n\n[edit]New York has some of the most expensive accommodations in the world. Expect to pay $100–$200 for a budget room with shared bath, $250–$350 for a mid-range hotel with a decent room and a restaurant and/or room service; and much higher in a high end hotel. Most accommodations below $200 in Manhattan are a small room with space only for a bed, a TV, perhaps a sink, and little else. Cheaper accommodations may have communal bathrooms (although many will have a sink in the room). Be warned that the quality of hotels varies significantly and, in many cheap hotels away from the center such as along the West Side Highway or in the outer reaches of Queens, you may share the premises with hourly customers! As New York is a popular destination throughout the year, it is necessary to make reservations well in advance. If you plan to be in the city during the height of the tourist season, booking months in advance would be wise. The two largest hotels in New York City are the Marriott Marquis (on Times Square) and the Hilton Midtown (on 6th Avenue between 53rd and 54th Streets); however, there are many other big-name hotels in the city, so the options are expansive.\n\n### Hostels\n\n[edit]Expect to pay up to $50 for a hostel. There are several hostels in Manhattan including an official Hostelling International hostel (located at 891 Amsterdam Avenue—between 102nd and 103rd Streets—in Manhattan), but there are many places that call themselves \"hostel\" and offer accommodations below $100 a night. Some cater exclusively to students. You are strongly advised to make reservations months in advance.\n\n### Taxes\n\n[edit]Room rates are typically quoted excluding taxes, so expect your actual bill to be materially higher than the quoted rate. Taxes include New York State and New York City sales tax (8.875%), a New York City Hotel Occupancy Tax (varies but, for rooms above $40, $2 + 5.875%), and a surcharge of $1.50. For a $100 per night room, expect to pay $117.75, after taxes are taken into account.\n\n### Alternatives to Manhattan accommodations\n\n[edit]You don't have to stay in Manhattan. There are many hotels just outside Manhattan in Long Island City, Queens, Brooklyn and New Jersey that are cheaper than hotels in Manhattan. Also, due to the high accommodation prices and insider knowledge of the locals, you may want to consider a hospitality exchange.\n\n### Off-season\n\n[edit]Lower accommodation prices are also generally available in January and February, the end of August, and on Sunday nights.\n\n## Connect\n\n[edit]Find free wireless wifi & hotspot across the city online at openwifinyc, NYC Wireless[dead link], and WiFi Free Spot. Wireless is available in city parks and quite a few public libraries. The Apple store has dozens of computers set up and doesn't seem to mind that many people use them for free internet access, but they can be pretty busy at times. Easy Internet Cafe and FedEx Office are just some of the internet cafes which offer broadband internet at reasonable prices. Finding a store with an open power outlet may be difficult so be sure your device is fully charged and its battery is working properly.\n\nPublic phones are less and less common, but there are now some free phone charging stations on the street if you are running out of power. Remember to include the 1 and area code when dialing from any phone in New York City - including private \"land line\" phones in buildings - as 11-digit dialing is always in effect, even when dialing locally. However, you don't need to dial 1 from a cell phone.\n\n## Stay safe\n\n[edit]Cautions about firearms: New York City has some of the nation's strictest gun laws, and handgun permits issued elsewhere — including New York State licenses — are not honored within the five boroughs of the city.\nSome popular venues have a \"No guns\" sign posted outside, leading people to falsely assume such weapons are prohibited only in certain places. In fact, they're just as illegal outside these venues as inside. Attempting to leave weapons with security guards or police prior to entry will likely lead to very serious criminal charges. As of Feb 2023, New York City's gun laws are in flux after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the city's gun permit law as unconstitutional. It is still advisable to avoid bringing a gun to New York City, even if you're just passing through by air (LaGuardia and JFK) or by car. | |\n\nNew York was through 2019 statistically the safest large city in the United States, and its crime rate per person was lower than the national average and the crime rate of many small towns. 2020 saw a frightening jump in shootings, people being pushed onto the subway tracks and bias crimes, with those against people who are or look Asian increasing at the greatest rate, and the violence continued in 2021 and into 2022, but there has been a big drop in crime since then, and even during the spike, the city remained much safer than it used to be in the 1980s and 1990s. You can be assured of a high police presence in Times Square, public transportation hubs and other major crowded places.\n\nThe most common crime against tourists (not including being overcharged, or scammed in the Times Square area) is bag snatching. Never let go of your handbag (putting other bags down is OK, as long as you guard them carefully), especially in the subway but also when eating at a restaurant. Take special care if you are sitting outdoors or in a crowded self-service restaurant. Leave your passport and other valuables that you don't need to carry in a hotel safe or hidden in your suitcase. Don't flaunt a wad of money if you can help it; if you want to be safer, count your money in your room before you go out and take only what you think you may need. Unless you have protective outer wear, consider not wearing expensive jewelry, and hide valuables like cameras when you're not using them.\n\nWhile muggings are rare, they do happen. Take a tip from seasoned New Yorkers and always try to be aware of who's walking near you in all directions (especially behind you), at all times. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you find yourself on a lightly traveled or poorly lit street. Certain neighborhoods that are off the tourist path should be avoided in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Riverside Park and Central Park can be dangerous at night. If you go to an evening outdoor concert at one of the parks, follow the crowd out of the park before heading toward your destination.\n\nAs of 2024, most neighborhoods that tourists or visitors to New York would venture into are quite safe. There are, however, some areas that have changed considerably since 2019 and would invite particular caution. These may not be immediately apparent to those unfamiliar with the city:\n\n- Be careful at all hours in the area encompassing the low 30s to low 40s, west of 8th Avenue. This area has a high homeless population and open drug use. Consider not walking on empty streets in this area at night. If your hotel or destination is in this area, consider taking a cab. Sticking to 34th Street or 42nd Street is a good bet if you are making your way west toward the river or Hudson Yards.\n- Sixth Avenue and side streets in the West Village (particularly around the West 4th Street-Washington Square subway station) can be a little dicey late at night, outside of weekends.\n- There are neighborhoods to the east of popular nightlife areas in Brooklyn that you can consider avoiding at night and visiting only during the day, particularly if you know where you're going and do not appear to be a tourist. These include eastern parts of Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant, as well as the neighborhoods of East New York, Brownsville, East Flatbush and Cypress Hills. The last four areas are particularly dangerous.\n\nIf you think you've inadvertently wandered into a dangerous area, hop into a cab, if available, or into the nearest subway station and go elsewhere, and if none of those is an option, don't hesitate to cross the street or duck into an open shop. If a subway platform is deserted, stay within sight of the station agent if possible. Trust your instincts; if a station or street feels unsafe, it's best to leave. In some areas (like the East New York LIRR station) helpful locals may even assist you in finding a safer place to go, or will wait/walk with you!\n\nAirport-style security is common at buildings, museums and tourist attractions, even the Main Branch of the New York Public Library. Generally you can expect to have your bags checked (either manually by a security guard or through an x-ray machine) and walk through a metal detector. Unlike their counterparts at JFK and LaGuardia, security screenings at building entrances are surprisingly quick and efficient - and you can even leave your shoes on!\n\nNew York has its share of odd people: talkative pan-handlers, lonely people just wanting a chat, religious preachers, people with psychological disorders, etc. If you prefer not to speak with someone who approaches you for a chat, do what most New Yorkers do: completely ignore them or say \"Sorry, gotta go\" while continuing to walk at a brisk pace.\n\nWatch out for cyclists and even motorcyclists riding, sometimes at high speeds, on the sidewalk or the wrong way on one-way streets. This has become a constant in some neighborhoods. Also, you will notice that New Yorkers routinely jaywalk (fun fact: jaywalking was legalized in New York City in 2025), but don't do it yourself unless you have good sight lines and can do so safely.\n\nDespite the stereotypes, many New Yorkers are nice people and don't mind giving out directions (time allowing), so don't be afraid to ask! If you ever get into trouble, approach the nearest police officer. You'll find them to be friendly, polite, and very helpful.\n\n## Cope\n\n[edit]### Water\n\n[edit]The quality of tap water in New York City is considered to be among the best in the world (unless you are in an old building with outdated plumbing). There is generally no good reason to drink bottled water in preference to New York City tap water. Lower-end restaurants will simply place glasses of ice water on your table (and refill them constantly, for free). At nicer restaurants you will be asked “what kind of water” you want. Asking for tap water is completely acceptable in any restaurant; your other choices are “bottled” (non-carbonated water, such as Fiji or Evian) or “sparkling” (which almost always means Pellegrino).\n\n### Noise\n\n[edit]Being the largest city in the country, New York City is true to its reputation as the \"city that never sleeps\". Traffic, honking horns, the loud chatter on the streets, musicians busking, and sirens are all undeniable parts of the city's soundscape.\n\nConsider buying a pair of earplugs or noise cancelling headphones to deal with the excessive noise.\n\n### Toilets\n\n[edit]Public restrooms are few and far between in New York City. The parks department maintains a list of \"comfort stations\" in their parks, and the one at Bryant Park in Manhattan is even something of a tourist attraction. Public libraries also have free restrooms, and some subway stations have restrooms open during the day. There are a small number of self-cleaning, coin-operated toilets in the city, which require quarters (25¢) and are always wheelchair-accessible. Large stores and sit-down restaurants usually have restrooms for paying customers. Otherwise, look for a church or police station that's open and ask if you can use the restroom.\n\n### Information\n\n[edit]- Citizen Service Center, ☏ 311 (lines open 24/7). New York City's official non-emergency help line, available in 171 languages for questions (parade hours and routes, parking restrictions, transport problems) and complaints (litter, noise pollution, access).\n\n### Babysitting\n\n[edit]- Baby Sitters' Guild, ☏ +1-212-682-0227. Bookings 9AM–9PM daily, cash payments only. For stressed and busy parents visiting New York, round-the-clock baby-sitting is available short- or long-term from $20 per hour (4-hour minimum) and cab fare (approx. $10). Multilingual sitters are also available.\n\n### Smoking\n\n[edit]Smoking in public places is highly restricted. It is prohibited in indoor sections of bars, restaurants, subway stations and trains (all transit system property), public parks, public beaches, pedestrian malls, both indoor and outdoor stadiums and sports arenas, and many other public places. If you light up in any of these places, you are subject to a summons and fine, ejection, and/or indignant reactions from residents. There do remain a small number of legal cigar bars that are exempt, as are the outside areas of sidewalk cafes and the like, but these are very much the exception. If you need to smoke while eating or drinking, be prepared to take a break and join the rest of the smokers outside, whatever the weather; many establishments have large space heaters.\n\nThere is also some vaping on the streets of New York.\n\n#### Cannabis/marijuana and other drugs\n\n[edit]**Cannabis and marijuana are legal in New York** for those 21 or older. Adults may possess up to 3 ounces of marijuana or up to 24 grams of cannabis concentrate and consume it anywhere tobacco smoking is permitted —— it is the only jurisdiction in the USA where public marijuana smoking is legal. You will smell it walking down the street with some frequency.\n\nNew Yorkers are embracing legal weed with typical impatience and irreverence, and cannabis sales occur openly in every tourist-dominated area of the city, including Times Square and most Manhattan & Brooklyn parks.\n\nBecause NYC law only prohibits driving under the influence of cannabis and possession thereof by minors/children, you'll be hard-pressed to find a cop who'll lift a finger to stop open cannabis sales (they have bigger fish to fry), though unfortunately the way a dealer is treated by police often depends on skin color. Purchase cannabis at your own risk, but only the dealer commits a crime.\n\n**Purchasing hard drugs in New York City is dangerous.** Penalties for possession are draconian, including long prison sentences, and legal representation is expensive. Fake hard drugs and hard drugs laced with poisonous fentanyl are common.\n\n### Consulates\n\n[edit]New York City is home to diplomatic missions from virtually every country on Earth due to the presence of the United Nations. Most countries have consulates here that double as the permanent mission to the United Nations, even if a country may otherwise not have diplomatic relations with the United States.\n\n| Diplomatic missions | list |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\n\n## Go next\n\n[edit]Locals would ask why you ever want to leave, but New York is a great jumping-off point to other locations in the metro area (including New Jersey and Connecticut) or anywhere in the Boston-Washington Megalopolis corridor.\n\n### New Jersey\n\n[edit]Despite being a constant target of mockery and jokes from New York, the densely-populated Garden State has plenty of great attractions to offer nearby:\n\n**Hudson Waterfront**— The portion of New Jersey that directly faces Manhattan along the Hudson River. The region is traversed by the 18.5-mile-long (29.8 km)**Hudson River Waterfront Walkway**that runs, albeit discontinuously, from the George Washington Bridge down to the city of Bayonne and offers clear views of the Manhattan skyline.**Jersey City**— Directly across the Hudson River from the Financial District is New Jersey's second largest city. Jersey City is a diverse city with lots of multicultural shops and restaurants, and it is often referred to as New York’s \"sixth borough\". It can be reached from Manhattan via the Holland Tunnel, the PATH trains (the bi-state subway), buses from Port Authority or the many ferries that zip passengers across the Hudson River.**Hoboken**— Directly across the Hudson River from the West Village and Chelsea is the alleged birthplace of baseball (most erroneously believe that the birthplace is Cooperstown, NY) and actual birthplace of Frank Sinatra. Hoboken is a small city in area with a great assortment of prewar buildings and conspicuous lack of many corporate establishments. The piers have great views of Manhattan, a large selection of bars, restaurants, and clubs, and are a good place to walk around. Hoboken can be reached from Manhattan by the PATH train or by bus from Port Authority as well as by NY Waterway ferries.**Fort Lee**— Occupying the western end of the George Washington Bridge, Fort Lee is home to the site of the eponymous Revolutionary War fort, as well as a high concentration of Korean and Japanese restaurants that spill deep into the neighboring towns. Fort Lee is easily reached by walking, biking, or taking a bus/jitney across the George Washington Bridge from the adjacent bus terminal on the Manhattan side of the bridge.\n\n**Jersey Shore**— The Jersey Shore starts just a few miles south of New York City. It stretches for almost 130 mi (210 km), and along it are private and public beaches. There are numerous activities along the Jersey Shore. Sandy Hook, part of the National Gateway Area and home to one of the few nude beaches around New York, Gunnison Beach, can be easily accessed using the SeaStreak ferry from Manhattan. The service operates during the beach season and goes directly to the Hook. A convenient train ride on the NJ Transit trains from Penn Station will get you to several more of the towns on the Jersey Shore, including Asbury Park, Manasquan and Point Pleasant Beach. Buses from Port Authority also take passengers to other spots along the Jersey Shore not served by train from New York, such as Seaside Heights.**Atlantic City**,**Wildwood**, and**Cape May**at the southern edge of New Jersey are home to beaches, casinos in Atlantic City, restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. Just a 2-hour drive from New York, and plenty of buses also operate to Atlantic City from Port Authority.\n\n**Six Flags Great Adventure**in Jackson — An 80-minute drive from Manhattan sits the largest regional theme park in the world. Six Flags Great Adventure features plenty of monster roller coasters and is next to the Wild Safari (one of the largest drive-through safaris in the world). There is also Six Flags Hurricane Harbor right next door (the largest water park in the Northeast). New Jersey Transit provides bus service from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan when the park is open (May–October).**Princeton**— Also an easy train ride on New Jersey Transit, Princeton offers a quiet, tree-lined town, good for strolling or for visiting the Princeton University campus. Take the Northeast Corridor line to Princeton Junction, then transfer to the shuttle train (known locally as the \"Dinky\") to ride directly into campus.**Newark**— Although most tourists only come here to arrive or depart in the city’s international airport, Newark is also home to Branch Brook Park, which contains one of the largest collections of cherry trees in the nation and makes for a great day trip during cherry blossom season in the spring, and the Ironbound, a district full of Portuguese, Brazilian, and Spanish restaurants and cuisine. Newark is a major transport hub in the New York area, with NJ Transit and PATH trains frequently operating to/from Midtown and Lower Manhattan.**Paterson**is a sizable, diverse city whose main attraction, the very extensive Great Falls of the Passaic River, is worth a trip if you have extra time during your visit to New York.\n\n### New York State\n\n[edit]**Long Island**— Many New Yorkers visit Long Island's beautiful long white sand beaches during the summer. You can take the Long Island Rail Road from Penn Station to Long Beach ($9.00 off-peak or $12.50 peak), and go to the beach there, or another option is to take a long day trip on the Hampton Jitney from various stops in NYC to the East End, where Long Island wine country is on the North Fork and The Hamptons are on the South Fork.**Fire Island**— an all-pedestrian summer-resort island off the coast of Long Island. Fire Island is home to many vacation communities on the western part of the island (Ocean Beach being the most populous, with the most restaurants and bars that make an excellent day trip). The eastern part of the island is home to the largely gay communities of Cherry Grove and the Fire Island Pines. Western Fire Island is reachable by ferry from Bay Shore on Long Island. Bay Shore is about an hour's train ride on the Long Island Rail Road from Manhattan, and the ferry ride from Bay Shore is another 30 minutes. Ferries to Ocean Beach from Bay Shore run about once every hour during the summer. Cherry Grove and the Fire Island Pines are reachable by ferry from Sayville. The easternmost community, Davis Park, is reachable by ferry from Patchogue.**The Palisades**— On the western bank of the Hudson River, there are cliffs that rise sharply. These cliffs are known as the Palisades. They range from 300 to 500 feet. They start in the northern portion of Jersey City and stretch all the way to Nyack, New York. There are numerous viewpoints, trails and campsites along the Palisades. The Palisades can be easily reached from Manhattan via the George Washington Bridge. Palisade Interstate Park and Parkway start north of the bridge.**Westchester County**and the**Hudson Valley**— Home to the country's only government-operated theme park - Rye Playland - as well as beautiful neighborhoods. There are pretty communities along the Long Island Sound and inland, and the Hudson Valley (which extends north of Westchester) is truly beautiful; the train route (Metro North Hudson Line to Poughkeepsie or Amtrak to Albany) along the Hudson River is one of the loveliest in the country. Westchester County starts just north of the NYC borough of the Bronx.**The Adirondacks**are the largest state park in the United States, and are only a 3- to 4-hour drive away on I-87. The area is home to mountains, small villages, and winter sports.- Western New York is the land of the\n**Finger Lakes**,**Niagara Falls**,**Thousand Islands**, and nice towns. Up to an 8-hour drive on the Thruway. - The\n**Woodbury Commons**in Orange County is one of the largest outlet shopping centers in the Northeast, with over 200 stores. Take exit 16 (Harriman) on I-87. If you don't have a car, there are several bus alternatives from Manhattan like Gray Line New York, Hampton Luxury Liner and Manhattan Transfer tours.\n\n### New England\n\n[edit]**New Haven, Connecticut**— 75 miles (121 km) away, New Haven is a 1-hour-45-minute ride from Grand Central Terminal via Metro North Railroad, and home to Yale University. Megabus and Greyhound also provide transportation.**Cape Cod**, a 5-hour drive from New York north on I-95, is home to nice towns, restaurants, beaches, shopping, and entertainment. Also accessible by Peter Pan Bus Lines.**Boston, Massachusetts**— Beantown, home to the Freedom Trail, incredible seafood, Harvard University in nearby Cambridge, and the Boston Red Sox (who are the most hated sports team of most New Yorkers), is 4 hours north on I-95 ($32-38 one way by bus on Greyhound and Peter Pan; Megabus sometimes charges more), with a bus from Port Authority Bus Terminal every hour around the clock or $20-102 one way on Amtrak's Northeast Regional from Penn Station as of April 2024 if bought far enough in advance.- The rest of\n**New England**has a lot to offer, including national parks, beaches, mountains and skiing.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\n[edit]**Philadelphia**— The birthplace of American independence and the nation's first capital is 1 hour 20 minutes away by Amtrak, very feasible for a day trip or side trip from New York City. A cheaper but somewhat slower method of getting there is to either take the NJ Transit Northeast Corridor Line to Trenton and change for SEPTA or take a bus from Midtown or Chinatown.**Washington, D.C.**is the capital of the United States and a three-hour train ride on the Acela. The National Mall, the White House, and the Lincoln Memorial are just a few of the numerous attractions that D.C. has to offer.- There are more beaches to check out in\n**Delaware**and**Maryland**, such as**Ocean City**and**Rehoboth Beach** **Montreal**is a 7-hour drive away, plus time to go through the checkpoint at the border. Also accessible by plane, Greyhound and Trailways and by a slow Amtrak trip.\n\n*For routeboxes with commuter rail trains, see Manhattan or other borough articles.*\n\nRoutes through New York City (by long-distance train) |\n\nWashington, D.C. ← Newark ← |\nSW NE |\n→ Stamford → Boston |\nAlbany (Rensselaer) ← Yonkers ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nPhiladelphia ← Newark ← |\nW E |\n→ END |\nEND ← |\nN S |\n→ Newark → Philadelphia |\nPhiladelphia ← Newark ← |\nW E |\n→ END |\nAlbany (Rensselaer) ← Croton-on-Hudson ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nPhiladelphia ← Newark ← |\nSW NE |\n→ New Rochelle → New Haven |\nPhiladelphia ← Newark ← |\nSW NE |\n→ Stamford → New Haven |\n\nRoutes through New York City (by car) |\n\nAllentown ← Jersey City ← |\nW E |\n→ END |\nAlbany ← Yonkers ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nNew Haven ← New Rochelle ← |\nN S |\n→ Fort Lee → Philadelphia |\nLinden ← Elizabeth ← |\nW E |\n→ Merges into N |\nWeehawken ← Becomes ← |\nW E |\n→ Plainview → Riverhead |\nAlbany ← Yonkers ← |\nN S |\n→ Fort Lee → Cape May |\nNew Haven ← Mount Vernon ← |\nN S |\n→ END |"}
{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Manhattan", "title": "Manhattan", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Manhattan", "text": "Wall Street. Madison Avenue. 34th Street. Broadway. Times Square. **Manhattan** is so well known that even the names of its streets have become iconic and understood the world over. This long, thin island is only one of New York City's five boroughs, but it's Manhattan that has the concrete canyons and the inimitable skyline; Manhattan that has the world's brightest theater district; Manhattan that has Central Park, Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building, and the Met; and Manhattan that includes iconic neighborhoods like Harlem, the Upper East Side, Times Square, and Greenwich Village.\n\nThe rest of New York City has much to see and do, but it's Manhattan that represents the city—and sometimes the entire United States—to the world. You could spend a month on this tiny island and still not see all there is to see. Grab a yellow taxi, hop on the subway, or just start walking, and you're sure to begin to understand just what it is that makes Manhattan, *Manhattan*.\n\n## Districts\n\n[edit]Manhattan (also known officially as **New York County** and informally called simply \"New York\" or \"The City\" locally) is divided broadly into three sections: **Downtown**, **Midtown**, and **Uptown**. In common parlance locally, to go \"Downtown\" in Manhattan means to \"go south\", while going \"Uptown\" means to \"go north\".\n\nThe districts south of 14th Street are considered part of Downtown. Midtown, as the name suggests, occupies the approximate middle reach of Manhattan Island, sandwiched between 14th Street and 59th Street/Central Park. Midtown is divided into a number of neighborhoods, often indistinct with considerable overlap between them. The districts located north of 59th Street are considered part of Uptown.\n\n### Downtown/Lower Manhattan\n\n[edit]Downtown, or Lower Manhattan, is the oldest part of the city, and considered the financial capital of the country, if not the world. The tallest skyscrapers are mostly downtown, along with some of the most interesting residential neighborhoods.\n\nFinancial District Long the center of the American economy, the Financial District is full of impressive turn-of-the-century buildings and is a hive of activity during the day. At night it clears out considerably, though it is becoming an increasingly residential area, giving it more flavor than it has had in the past. Wall Street, the World Trade Center site, South Street Seaport, and Battery Park — a departure point for ferries to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, Staten Island, and Governors Island — are all in this neighborhood. |\n\nTriBeCa The \" Triangle Below Canal Street\". Home to Robert DeNiro's annual film festival, it is popular with the affluent crowd and replete with trendy restaurants. Unlike SoHo to the north, Tribeca is not over-filled with shoppers on weekends, and Greenwich Street could be mistaken for the main street of a beautifully preserved small town. |\n\nSoHo \" South of Houston Street\" flows north from Canal Street between the Hudson River and Lafayette St. The ultimate urban gentrification story, SoHo was a rundown industrial area until the 1960s, when artists began inhabiting its spacious and then-cheap lofts. After the artists came the galleries, then the celebrities, then the shoppers, and now the visitors. Filled with gorgeous cast-iron architecture (on Greene Street especially), SoHo is a great shopping and dining destination, even if many of the artists have moved on. |\n\nChinatown Chinatown retains its scruffy, exotic atmosphere, especially around Mott and Canal Streets. The diminishing Little Italy still exists on Mulberry Street (and comes out in full force for Italian festivals such as the Feast of San Gennaro in September), but the surrounding blocks are morphing into fashionable Nolita (\" North of Little Italy\") or have been annexed by Chinatown. |\n\nLower East Side Famous as the Jewish immigrant ghetto of the early 20th century, the neighborhood today is enjoying a renaissance, with dozens of bars and restaurants. |\n\nGreenwich Village Coffee houses, wine bars, lowrise but high art and literary connections, all between Houston and 14th Streets. The bohemian center of yore, today's Village is strongly upmarket but retains its diverse flavor, with its historic community around Christopher Street and thousands of students who attend NYU. |\n\nEast Village Diverse and gentrified but perhaps still hip, this area lies east of Broadway. Pockets of Ukrainians, Japanese, South Asians and young professionals make it one of the most vibrant Manhattan areas. The once-shabby area formerly known as Alphabet City, centered on Avenues A through D, is now considered part of the East Village. |\n\n### Midtown Manhattan\n\n[edit]As the name suggests, Midtown Manhattan occupies the approximate middle reach of Manhattan Island, sandwiched between Lower Manhattan (below 14th Street) and Upper Manhattan (above 59th Street/Central Park). Like the financial district, Midtown Manhattan is also home to many skyscrapers. Midtown is divided into a number of neighborhoods, often indistinct. They are as follows:\n\nChelsea Having superseded Greenwich Village as the primary center of New York's gay community, this appealing district has a great mix of fashion, design, art, culture, bars and restaurants. |\n\nGramercy Flatiron A chic, stylish district of stately residential areas, gardens and squares, trendy restaurants and bars. |\n\nTheater District The name says it all: Broadway, Times Square, 42nd Street, Hell's Kitchen, Columbus Circle; often overlapping in the area between Fifth and Sixth Avenues with Midtown East. The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum is down on the Hudson River. |\n\nMidtown East This extensive area east of Sixth Avenue includes a number of New York icons including the United Nations, Grand Central Terminal, Empire State Building and Chrysler Building. |\n\n### Uptown/Upper Manhattan\n\n[edit]The districts north of 59th Street are considered part of \"Uptown\":\n\nCentral Park With its lawns, trees and lakes, it is popular for recreation and concerts and is home to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Central Park Zoo. |\n\nUpper East Side Primarily a residential neighborhood, it remains New York City's wealthiest. Museums and restaurants abound. |\n\nUpper West Side Often called the city's quintessential neighborhood and made famous by TV's Seinfeld, it includes delightful residential streets, the twin-towered facades of the old apartment hotels on Central Park West and Riverside Drive, Columbia University, large and impressive churches, two of the city's best-known markets (Zabar's and Fairway) and one of its major museums – the American Museum of Natural History. |\n\nHarlem and Upper Manhattan Harlem, America's most famous black community, is home to an increasingly diverse mix of cultures. East Harlem (aka Spanish Harlem), the traditional center of Latino culture in Manhattan, has been joined by the lively, predominantly Dominican neighborhoods of West Harlem and Washington Heights. Washington Heights, which is north of Harlem, is notable for Fort Tryon Park, the home of The Cloisters (the Medieval annex of the Metropolitan Museum). At the northern tip of Manhattan, Inwood's claim to fame is Inwood Hill Park, the last remaining virgin forest on the island. |\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]### Orientation\n\n[edit]|\nHouston Street\nAlthough it may have the same spelling as the city of Houston in Texas, unlike that name, the name of this street is actually pronounced |\n\nMost of Manhattan is laid out in a grid. By convention, Manhattan is spoken of as if it runs north to south (it's actually northeast to southwest), with **streets** running east-west and **avenues** running north-south. This makes it relatively easy and straightforward to find your way.\n\nExcept for downtown Manhattan south of Houston Street and Greenwich Village between Houston St. and 14th St. on the west side, streets are numbered and the numbering rises as you go north, starting at 1st Street just above Houston and running up to 220th Street at the northern end of the island. As a guide to distance, there are roughly 20 street blocks per mile.\n\nNorth of Houston St., avenues are either named or numbered, and are more widely spaced than streets, with one mile being approximately seven avenues. Park Avenue is a continuation of 4th Avenue, while Lexington Avenue (between 3rd and Park Avenues) can be thought of as a \"3½ Avenue\" and Madison Avenue (between Park and 5th Avenues) can be thought of as a \"4½ Avenue\". On the Upper West Side, Columbus Ave. is a continuation of 9th, Amsterdam Ave. is a continuation of 10th, and West End Ave. is a continuation of 11th.\n\nAbove 8th St., 5th Avenue divides Manhattan into east and west; address numbering starts at 5th Avenue on each side (except where Central Park interrupts) and increases in either direction. Addresses west of 5th Avenue are written as, for example, 220 W 34th Street, while those east of 5th Avenue are written as 220 E 34th Street. For numbered streets below 8th St., Broadway divides the streets into east and west. Address numbering on avenues starts at the south end of the avenue and rises as you move north. In Greenwich Village and downtown Manhattan, all bets are off as streets meander, dead-end and intersect themselves.\n\n### History\n\n[edit]The area that is now Manhattan was once inhabited by the Lenape Indians, and the name Manhattan is believed to be derived from the Lenape word \"*Manna-hata*\", which has been translated as \"island of many hills.\" Today, most of those hills have either been paved over or considerably softened, although you can still get some sense of what the natural landscape of Manhattan looked like at Inwood Hill Park, on the northern tip of the island.\n\nThe first European to set foot on Manhattan was Henry Hudson, an Englishman who mapped the area for the Dutch East India Company in 1609. Dutch settlers arrived in 1625, establishing a fort on the southern tip of the island and naming their settlement \"New Amsterdam.\" English soldiers took the settlement by force in the 1660s and renamed it \"New York,\" after the Duke of York (who later became King James II). Under British rule, New York became an important hub of business in the American colonies, as well as a center of dissent against said British rule. The Stamp Act Congress met here and the Sons of Liberty developed on Manhattan in opposition to \"taxation without representation.\" Manhattan was at the center of an early military campaign during the Revolutionary War, which resulted in General George Washington's forces abandoning New York to the British, who occupied the settlement until the end of the war. New York briefly served as the first capital of the new nation, with George Washington returning to take the oath of office as the first president of the United States.\n\nThrough the 19th century, Manhattan grew rapidly, becoming the center of a sprawling metropolis. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 and the growth of the city's banking sector established New York's importance as an economic center for the nation. The rate of immigration rose sharply, particularly in the years after the Civil War, with millions of newcomers coming to the city in hopes of a better life. The massive demand for housing and high immigration rate turned Manhattan into a city of industry and tenements and gave it its international flair, becoming a hotbed of political racketeering as well as the labor movement. The pressures of the urban landscape led to the creation of new parks, most notably Central Park, and new connections to the neighboring cities such as the Brooklyn Bridge that connected the cities of New York (then consisting of Manhattan only) and Brooklyn helped to bring about the unification of today's five boroughs into the Greater New York in 1898.\n\nThe early decades of the 20th century saw even more growth, with the creation of the subway system offering a way to move easily around the crowded island and the first of Manhattan's skyscrapers, giving rise to the city's famous skyline. The economic boom of Midtown led to the borough's two skylines, with Midtown now competing (and often winning) as the dominant business and civic district versus the older Financial District downtown. The Great Migration of African-Americans from the South led to the renaissance of Harlem, which has since remained an important center of African-American culture. The Art Deco landmarks of the 1930s (most notably the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building) were joined by the modernist skyscrapers of the post-WWII economic boom, including the headquarters of the United Nations.\n\nThe boom years of the mid-century ended with Manhattan's economic decline in the 1960s and 70s. The departure of all port and industrial activity, as well as much of the city's tax base, brought intense poverty and a reputation of Manhattan as crime-ridden and graffiti-covered. However, Manhattan has come a long way since, as the rise of the financial industry and a new real estate boom has led to intense gentrification of the borough's neighborhoods. But while this trend has occurred alongside a reduced crime rate and a cleaner reputation, it has also resulted in the outflow of many of the borough's older residents and grittier character. Today, the Lower East Side and portions of Upper Manhattan are the only neighborhoods with some of the old grit, and even those are gentrifying. Some locals regard Manhattan as overpriced, tourist-centric, and lacking the character of the other boroughs. However, Manhattan remains the undisputed center of business, power, and prominence in the city – if not the *nation* – with evocative landmarks and a setting that continues to inspire awe from its many visitors.\n\n### Visitor information\n\n[edit]- NYC Information Center at Macy's Herald Square, 151 W. 34th St (between 7th Ave and Broadway, inside Macy's), ☏ +1 212 484-1222.

Guides, maps, pamphlets, brochures, and bilingual staff available for questions.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]*See the New York City page for details on how to get to New York City.*\n\n### By train\n\n[edit]There are three railway stations with access to points outside of New York City, two of which are in Midtown. The largest, 1 Pennsylvania Station (Penn Station for short), between 31st and 33rd Streets on 7th Avenue, is served by Amtrak, the Long Island Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. 2 Grand Central Terminal, at Park Avenue and 42nd Street, is an architectural delight and the hub of the Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Railroad to other points in Downstate New York and Connecticut. Metro-North trains also stop at **Harlem–125th Street** at Park Avenue and 125 Street, a useful stop for travelers headed for Harlem or other points in Upper Manhattan.\n\nAdditionally, a subway system called **PATH** connects Manhattan with Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark across the Hudson River. One line serves the World Trade Center in downtown while another crosses under the river to Greenwich Village before continuing along 6th Avenue to Midtown, making stops at Christopher, 9th, 14th, 23rd, and 33rd Streets.\n\n### By road\n\n[edit]Manhattan being an island, access (whether by car, taxi, bus or by foot) has generally to be made by means of either a bridge or a tunnel. A pedestrian can walk into Manhattan over the Brooklyn, Manhattan, or Williamsburg Bridges from Brooklyn, the Queensboro or RFK (formerly Triboro) Bridges from Queens, all the numerous small street bridges from the Bronx, and the George Washington Bridge from New Jersey. Probably the most famous of these is the Brooklyn Bridge. If you're coming from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) by cab, consider asking the driver to take the Queensboro or Williamsburg Bridges into Manhattan if you're going to Midtown or Downtown, respectively, and save yourself the RFK Bridge or Queens-Midtown Tunnel toll. Buses from New Jersey and other long-distance buses most commonly terminate at Port Authority Bus Terminal, 41st St. between 8th and 9th Avs., while others terminate in Chinatown (See Manhattan/Chinatown#By long distance bus for more information).\n\nThe MTA has plans to introduce a fee for motor vehicles entering Manhattan south of 60th Street. The fee will be $9 for vehicles entering Manhattan south of 60th Street (except for the West Side Highway and FDR Drive). These are set to take effect on January 5, 2025, though lawsuits to stop it have been filed.\n\n### By plane\n\n[edit]While there is no airport in Manhattan (see the NYC page for details on airports serving the area), there are helicopter and seaplane services into the city. At least two companies provide helicopter services between Manhattan and area airports, from helipads on W34th Street, E34th Street, and Wall Street. Seaplane services are available to East Hampton from E23rd Street during the summer months. Neither are for the faint of pocket – the helicopter service costs $125 or more while the seaplane service costs $425 per person. Scheduled helicopter services are also available to the airport in Bridgeport, CT from Manhattan.\n\n- 3 West 30th Street Heliport (\n**JRA**IATA). Blade from East Hampton, Southampton, JFK Airport, LGA Airport, EWR Airport, Montauk Airport. - 4 East 34th Street Heliport (Atlantic Metroport, FAA LID:\n**6N5**). - 5 Downtown Manhattan Heliport (\n**JRB**IATA). Charter service from Newark Liberty International Airport, Teterboro Airport, Morristown Municipal Airport, and other New York-area airports.\n\n### By ferry\n\n[edit]Passengers from Staten Island usually take the free Staten Island Ferry to get to the Battery at the lower tip of Manhattan. The Battery also houses ferries to Liberty and Ellis Islands and Governors Island. Other ferries transport passengers to and from Brooklyn and parts of New Jersey.\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]*See the New York City page for specific information on getting around.*\n\nThe best ways to get around Manhattan are on foot, by cab, or by taking the subway or bus. Driving is strongly discouraged; most Manhattanites do not own cars and the infrastructure of the city is designed for people rather than for automobiles.\n\n### By taxi\n\n[edit]When traveling by cab, it is best to ensure that you are using a licensed cab; the easiest way is to ask at the concierge at your hotel to flag down one of the ubiquitous yellow cabs or do so yourself. All licensed cabs are yellow, and no unlicensed (as a taxicab) livery services may be yellow. Cabs which are available have their lights on and do not have their \"Off Duty\" sign lit. Off duty taxi drivers may choose to drive you if they are going your way, but are under no obligation to pick you up, and cabs which are not lit have customers inside and cannot pick up more customers. Fare for trips within Manhattan is strictly by meter (ask the cabbie to turn the meter on if s/he makes no move to turn it on after you've said where you want to go), plus whatever tip you choose to give (note that it is customary and expected to tip at least 10% to 15% for normal service). For trips to the Outer Boroughs, if toll bridges or tunnels are taken, you are responsible for the tolls in addition to the fare on the meter plus the tip. Do not try to take cabs during shift changes (such as around 4PM on weekdays), if you are in a rush, because you'll find that they are almost all off duty. Limousines (approximately $30 per hour for in-Manhattan use of a sedan) are an attractive alternative to medallion (yellow) cabs if you know you'll need to be driven around a lot during a short period of time. If you are north of West 110th St or East 96th St you can also use a boro taxi. Unlike yellow cabs, they are light green and have no medallions on the hood. These cabs are barred from picking up passengers in Manhattan south of West 110th St or East 96th St and may not enter the airport dispatcher lines. They can, however, pick up passengers in northern Manhattan and the other boroughs, and can drop off passengers anywhere. Fares and rules are otherwise identical to yellow cabs.\n\n### By public transit\n\n[edit]Maps of the New York subway system and Manhattan buses, schedules of subway and bus lines, and information about temporary service changes due to construction can be found online. Bus schedules and route maps are also usually posted on poles at bus stops. Bus schedules in Manhattan are only approximate: actual times depend on traffic and other variables.\n\n### By bike\n\n[edit]Cycling in Manhattan can often be quicker than taking the subway or a taxi, but it isn't for the fainthearted. The borough's tumultuous traffic makes biking difficult. Aggressive cab drivers, jaywalking pedestrians, potholes and debris on the roads create a cycling experience that might just as well have been taken from Dante's *Inferno*. If you do venture into the concrete jungle on a bike, make sure you wear a helmet and have sufficient experience in urban cycling. A map of bike paths in New York City can be found here.\n\nThe city has a new bike share program called **CitiBike**. The program has many stations throughout Lower and Midtown Manhattan. A map can be found here. To access a bike, first visit one of the locations and pay for a pass. A single ride costs $3 for every 30 minutes. 24-hour passes cost $12 and 3-day passes cost $24 (tax not included). You will receive a card and a code; enter the code into a bike, and you can use it. After 30 minutes of use, you will be charged overtime fees. Return your bike to a station (remember to place it securely in a dock–you will be further fined if the light on the dock does not turn green) within 30 minutes to avoid this. You can take out another bike and continue your journey if necessary. Using CitiBike is **not** recommended if you plan on using a bike for a prolonged period of time.\n\n### By carriage\n\n[edit]One alternative way of getting around Manhattan is to ride in a horse-drawn carriage. Horse-drawn carriages around Central Park South offer rides around the park for 15 minutes, half an hour, or one hour. Rates should be posted on the carriage. This can be a romantic or fun way to see the city. Pedicabs have also appeared in New York of late, and the city is in the early stages of licensing and enforcing safety regulations for them.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\nManhattan is home to many of New York's premier tourist attractions. Following is a selection of the highlights and \"must sees\" - the remainder will be found within the articles for the various Manhattan districts and neighborhoods.\n\n### Landmarks\n\n[edit]With constant portrayals in every method of media known, Manhattan's landmarks are known around the world, and seemingly every visitor to the city will make an effort to glimpse these most famous of buildings and monuments. Every neighborhood of Manhattan has local landmarks, and in many cases the neighborhoods themselves are landmarks in their own right; this is just a summary of the very most monumental architecture on the island.\n\nStarting where the city began in the Financial District, you can view some of the most powerful and evocative landmarks of the city. **Wall Street**, the center of the financial world and the heart of Lower Manhattan, is home to the **New York Stock Exchange** and **Federal Hall**, where George Washington was inaugurated as president. Just to the north of Wall Street is the **City Hall** area, flanked on the east by the **Brooklyn Bridge** and the west by the **Woolworth Building**, the \"Cathedral of Commerce\", once the tallest building in the world. A different kind of landmark lies to the west, where the National September 11 Memorial sits at the site of the former **World Trade Center** towers. To the south, out in the harbor are the **Statue of Liberty** and **Ellis Island**, once the first impressions of many Americans-to-be.\n\nHeading north across the \"valley\", the neighborhoods of shorter buildings separating the two major business districts, you'll come to Midtown Manhattan, a hub of activity non-stop. The **Empire State Building** dominates the surrounding area, while the iconic **Chrysler Building** stakes its ground nearby. In the midst of all these tall structures you'll also find **Grand Central Terminal**, the main branch of the **New York Public Library**, and the touristy **Rockefeller Center**. Facing the East River is the **United Nations Headquarters**, while to the west in the Theater District sits the insanely crowded tourist hub of **Times Square**.\n\n### Museums\n\n[edit]New York City is home to museums of every kind, and Manhattan is where the grandest and some of the most fascinating are. Why not start at \"Museum Mile\", or 5th Avenue along Central Park in Uptown Manhattan? Here you'll find the **Metropolitan Museum of Art**, one of the largest and most important museums of art in the world. Nearby in the Upper East Side and the Harlem area sits the famous Frank Lloyd Wright-designed **Guggenheim Museum**, the **Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum**, the **Jewish Museum**, the **Museum of the City of New York**, and the **El Museo Del Barrio**. Across Central Park in the Upper West Side is the massive **American Museum of Natural History**, one of the largest science museums in the world, and the **American Folk Art Museum**. At the northern end of Manhattan sits **The Cloisters**, a medieval-themed extension of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nIn Midtown you'll find the **Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)**, one of the most popular collections of modern art in the world. Nearby is the **Paley Center for Media**, devoted to television and radio. **Theodore Roosevelt's Birthplace** is just to the south in Flatiron, while the **Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum** sits on the Hudson River near the Theater District. The contemporary **Whitney Museum of American Art** has moved to a new location in the Meatpacking District.\n\nThe neighborhoods of Lower Manhattan are home to a number of small, more specialized museums. In the Financial District you'll find the **African Burial Ground National Monument**, the **Museum of American Finance**, the **Museum of Jewish Heritage**, the **National Museum of the American Indian**, and the **South Street Seaport Museum**. Just north in Chinatown is the **Museum of Chinese in the Americas**, while over in the Lower East Side is the **Lower East Side Tenement Museum**, the **Museum at Eldridge Street**, and the **New Museum**.\n\n### Parks and gardens\n\n[edit]Of course, no visit to Manhattan would be complete without a visit to **Central Park**, by far the largest and most famous park in this borough. Visit the park on a sunny day and join the many New Yorkers and other visitors relaxing on the park benches, biking, looking at the ducks on the pond, boating on the lake, visiting the small Central Park Zoo, sunbathing on the Sheep Meadow, iceskating at the Wollman Rink, or seeing a concert or play. But Central Park is far from the only green space to be found in Manhattan.\n\nIn Uptown Manhattan, **Fort Tryon Park** contains one of the highest points and some of the best views on the island, as well as the Cloisters Museum, a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Nearby at the northern tip of Manhattan is **Inwood Park**, the last remaining virgin forest on the island; many arrowheads and other Native American artifacts have been found here. Not as far north along the Hudson River is **Riverside Park**, a long stretch of parkland running from 59th Street all the way to 155th Street which makes for a lovely stroll or picnic overlooking the waters of the Hudson River and New Jersey on the opposite bank. **Carl Schurz Park** in the Upper East Side is the home of the Gracie Mansion, the Official Residence of the Mayor of New York. This park boasts wonderful views of Hell Gate and the East River and is extremely quiet compared to other New York parks.\n\nMoving into the bustle of Midtown, the parks get smaller but are no less frequent. Here you'll find the social centers of New York life, like **Bryant Park**, a small and charming park behind the New York Public Library which went through a major renovation in the late 1980s and has gained a hard-won reputation for being much better. Free movies on summer nights are incredibly popular. Just south of the canyons of Midtown in Flatiron is **Union Square**, a crowded social center and long the center for political protests, as well as the home of a popular greenmarket and resting visitors and locals alike. **Madison Square Park**, a lovely oasis in a bustling area, has beautiful flowering trees and bushes in the spring and boasts views of the Flatiron, Metropolitan Life, and Empire State buildings. On the western side of Midtown is **Hudson River Park**, whose promenade, still in progress, will run along the Hudson River from 59th Street to the southern tip of the island. Nearby in Chelsea is the new **High Line Park**, built on a defunct railway that runs 30 feet above the street.\n\nIn Lower Manhattan, parks like **Washington Square Park** in Greenwich Village, **Tompkins Square Park** in the East Village, and **Columbus Park** in Chinatown are excellent cosmopolitan spaces which are centers of neighborhood life. In the Financial District is **City Hall Park**, a small but delightful square (most of the grass is fenced off for security) which makes an excellent spot to rest after walking over the Brooklyn Bridge. At the very southern tip of the island, **Battery Park** is famous for its great views of the New York Harbor, Ellis Island, and the Statue of Liberty. The ferries to the Statue and Staten Island depart from Battery Park.\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\nPerhaps the most obvious thing to do in Manhattan is to **walk.** A lot. One of the greatest things to see in Manhattan *is* Manhattan. Get out and experience it! Stroll through Central Park, saunter along the tree-lined streets of Greenwich Village, take a walk along the High Line, head down 5th Avenue, and experience the scruffiness of Chinatown and the bustle of Times Square first hand.\n\n### Sports\n\n[edit]**Madison Square Garden**, atop Penn Station in Midtown, is the main sports venue on Manhattan, playing host to major concerts, conventions, and many sporting events, as well as the **New York Rangers** NHL hockey team, the **New York Knicks** NBA basketball team, and many **St. John's Red Storm** college men's basketball games. Madison Square Garden also plays host to two major college basketball tournaments, the ** Big East Conference Men's Basketball Tournament** and the **National Invitation Tournament**.\n\nIf tickets to Madison Square Garden are too expensive, there are plenty of places in Manhattan to watch more informal, amateur matches for free; among the more notable spots are **Pier 40** on the Hudson River at the end of Houston Street, which has baseball, soccer and rugby fields, kayaking and rowing, and trapeze artists, and the many recreational facilities of **Central Park**. Here, you are more than welcome to watch and maybe even join in. Another place of note is the **West 4th Street Courts** in Greenwich Village, the site of many intense pick-up games that's legendary in street basketball.\n\n### Performing arts\n\n[edit]Manhattan's **Broadway** is famous for its many shows, especially musicals. You might want to visit TKTS online, which offers tickets for shows the same night at discounted prices, usually 50% off or visit BroadwayBox.com or NYTix.com, community sites posting all recent Broadway discounts. TKTS has two offices, one at Times Square with lines often hours long, and a much faster one (sometimes minutes) at South Street Seaport (corner of John St, just south of Brooklyn Bridge). Note that only cash is accepted at South Street. Show up at opening time for best selection. Tickets to most Broadway shows are also available from the Broadway Concierge and Ticket Center[dead link], inside the Times Square Visitor Center. They offer restaurant and hotel recommendations, parking help, and other services in addition to ticket sales, available in several languages.\n\nTheatrical performances usually fall into one of three categories: Broadway, Off-Broadway, or Off-Off-Broadway. *Broadway* refers to the shows near Times Square that play to theaters of 500 seats or more. These include the major musicals and big-name dramatic works, and are the most popular with visitors. Tickets for Broadway shows can run to hundreds of dollars a seat, though discounters make cheaper seats available. *Off-Broadway* indicates performances that are smaller (fewer than 500 seats). Some of these theaters are located around Times Square in addition to different locations throughout Manhattan. Tickets to Off-Broadway shows tend to range from $50–100. *Off-Off-Broadway* refers to those shows that play to very small audiences (fewer than 100 seats) with actors working without equity. These can be dirt cheap and often very good, but sometimes more avant-garde. Off-Off-Broadway Theaters worth checking out are Rising Sun Performance Company[dead link], and The People's Improv Theater.\n\nFor current and upcoming Broadway and Off-Broadway info and listings, visit Playbill.com. This site also has lots of articles on what's going on in the NY commercial theater scene. Broadway.com and Newyorkcitytheatre.com also has plenty of info, as well as some videos and photos. Theatermania has many discounts to the bigger shows, and also provides listings for the Off-Off scene. NYTix.com also has discounts, but when some of the more popular Broadway shows won't be discounting, you can go here to find out how to get last minute tickets, and help visitors navigate their way through the different options for buying. If visiting in the summer, brave the huge lines and attempt to get tickets to the Public Theater's annual \"Shakespeare in the Park,\" a free performance which often features big-time stars of stage and screen. Just get to one of the box offices ridiculously early, especially the one at the Park.\n\nIt's possible to purchase tickets to the **Tony Awards**, Broadway's biggest award ceremony and the culmination of the theatrical season in the city. These aren't cheap, but if you're into the theater scene and know something about the various performers being honored, it can be an exciting night. In any case, the performances are always fun, and you can catch moments that aren't in the broadcast. Always the first or second Sunday night in June, visit The Tony Awards website[dead link] for the most current details.\n\nJust a few of New York's most high-profile music and dance options include **Carnegie Hall** – the premier venue for classical music in the United States – in the Theater District, **Radio City Music Hall** – home of the Rockettes – in Midtown, the **Joyce Theater** in Chelsea – a premier venue for contemporary dance and ballet – and the **Lincoln Center** in the Upper West Side, home to the Chamber Music Society, the Metropolitan Opera (\"the Met\"), the New York City Ballet, and the New York Philharmonic, all of which are among the most prestigious in the world in their respective art forms. The Lincoln Center also hosts jazz concerts at **Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola**. Jazz aficionados should check out the **Village Vanguard** in Greenwich Village and the **Birdland** in the Theater District. The legendary **Apollo** in Harlem remains the nation's most popular arena for emerging and established black and Latino performers. There are also many, many other concert halls, bars and clubs throughout Manhattan and numerous small companies putting on more idiosyncratic shows every night of the week.\n\n### Film\n\n[edit]Manhattan is home to a huge variety of theaters, from major cineplexes which play host to premiers of major US studio releases (especially in the autumn) to smaller theaters playing independent and repertory programs. Movies are quite popular, and even relatively obscure films at unappealing times of the day can still be sold out. It's best to get tickets in advance whenever possible. As many films premiere in New York, you can often catch a moderated discussion with the director or cast after the show. Sometimes even repertory films will have post-screening discussions or parties. Check listings for details.\n\nAmong the many commercial multiplexes are the huge **AMC Empire** at 42nd St and 8th Ave, the **Ziegfeld Theater** on 54th St between 6th and 7th Avenues, and the **Regal Union Square** at Broadway and 13th. In addition to these, some of the more intriguing New York film options include the many theaters in Greenwich Village, Soho, and the East Village which play independent and foreign releases, many of which are screened only in New York, including the **Film Forum** (which also has an excellent repertory programming schedule), the **IFC Center**, the **Quad Cinema**, the **Angelika Film Center**, **Cinema Village**, and the **Anthology Film Archives**. Additionally, the **MoMa** in Midtown puts on a terrific repertory program (and compared to other New York movie theaters, tickets to films at MoMA are a steal), as does the **Film Society at Lincoln Center** in the Upper West Side.\n\nAdditionally, there are many film festivals held in Manhattan. Perhaps the most prestigious is the **New York Film Festival**, organized by the Film Society at Lincoln Center and held at Lincoln Center in early October, with a terrific repertory program and a wide variety of experimental and foreign films. The **Tribeca Film Festival**, originally organized by Robert De Niro, is held every May and has already become a major event for film-goers in New York.\n\n### Television\n\n[edit]Many of the major national networks are headquartered in Midtown Manhattan and have studios where well-known programs are taped; listed below are just some of the most popular ones. Tickets are usually free, but very high in demand. If you have a particular show in mind, your best bet will be to go to the website of the show itself to find details on viewing a live taping.\n\n**NBC Studios**is located in the Comcast Building at Rockefeller Center and is the home of NBCUniversal Media and its flagship shows, including*Saturday Night Live*, which has been shot in Studio 8H since its debut in 1975;*The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon*, and*Today*, the morning news program produced daily from a streetside studio across from the main building. Tours of the facilities are available.**The Ed Sullivan Theatre**at 1697 Broadway (at 53rd Street, just north of Times Square) is named after the host of the classic*The Ed Sullivan Show*and is the stage where The Beatles made their American television debut in 1964, as well as where Michael Jackson got started on his path to greatness as part of the Jackson 5. It's the home of CBS'*Late Show*, previously hosted by comedian David Letterman and now hosted by Stephen Colbert.**Lincoln Square**boasts programming produced for ABC-TV, such as*The View*and*Who Wants to Be a Millionaire*at the network's West 66th Street facility, and*Live with Kelly and Ryan*, which is based at the WABC-TV studio at 67th Street and Columbus Avenue. WABC has introduced a streetside studio in the area for its local newscasts.**Times Square Studios**at Broadway and 44th is the home of ABC's*Good Morning America*, which tapes in a streetside studio with floor-to-ceiling windows which allows you to view the program from outside.- Comedy Central's popular\n*The Daily Show*is taped in a studio at 733 11th Avenue (at 52nd St) in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood west of Times Square.\n\n### Events\n\n[edit]\n\nManhattan hosts many parades, street festivals, outdoor pageants, holiday gatherings, and conventions throughout the year. The following are only the largest and most famous of events; you will also find many small, local festivals taking place in virtually every neighborhood.\n\n**Times Square Ball**. Times Square plays host to one of the best-known New Year's Eve celebrations in the world, where a million spectators pack the square to witness a ball drop atop the One Times Square building. Expect celebrity appearances and a whole lot of confetti.- The\n**Chinese New Year**in late January or early February brings a huge and colorful festival to Manhattan's Chinatown, with lots of food and music, as well as a parade with elaborate floats, marching bands, acrobats, and lion and dragon dances. - The\n**Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show**takes place in Madison Square Garden every February and is perhaps the most famous dog show in the world, drawing well-trained dogs, their owners, and plenty of dog lovers from around the world. **St. Patrick's Day Parade**. The largest St. Paddy's parade in the world (nearly two million spectators!) happens along Fifth Avenue from 44th Street to 86th Street and lasts from 11AM to about 2:30PM. Celebrations in pubs citywide happen the rest of the day and night until the green beer runs out.**Easter Parade**. Once an expression of wealth so famous it inspired songs and a classic movie, the Easter Parade today is an informal gathering of families and couples, often dressed in their Sunday best and wearing Easter bonnets as they stroll up Fifth Avenue.**Salute to Israel Parade**. Every first Sunday in June brings a huge celebration of Israeli culture, with many Jewish schools and synagogues taking part in a parade along Fifth Avenue in the Upper East Side, a concert in Central Park, and local vendors serving kosher food.**The Philippine Independence Day Parade**. Every first Sunday in June is a lavish celebration of Philippine culture along Madison Avenue. The parade ends at East 23rd Street near Madison Park. There are a lot of vendors selling traditional food, desserts, and drinks. There are dance and singing performances at the tail end of the march.**Pride Week**in late June is a massive event and has a lot of activities, including a rally, concerts, a street festival, and one of the largest LGBT Pride Parades in the world; fitting for the setting of the Stonewall Riots, the event that launched the modern Gay Rights Movement. The Pride March starts in Midtown and makes its way down Fifth Avenue and past the site of the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village.**Independence Day**. The 4th of July brings plenty of BBQs, concerts, and rooftop parties to the city, culminating in a*massive*fireworks display over the river (the location has shifted from the East River to the Hudson), one of the largest (if not*the*largest) fireworks displays in the country.**Columbus Day Parade**. Taking place on the second Monday in October, this parade draws nearly a million spectators to Fifth Avenue and is a massive celebration of Italian-American culture.**New York Comic Con**. Held in mid-October, the NYCC has quickly become one of the country's largest fan conventions, attracting over 100,000 attendees to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on the west side of Midtown. Many notable comic figures have made appearances, and it is a huge celebration of fan culture.**New York's Village Halloween Parade**. Each Halloween (October 31) evening, this parade and street pageant attracts two million spectators and 50,000 costumed participants along Sixth Avenue between Spring Street and 21st Street. Anyone in a costume is welcome to march; those wishing to should show up early at Spring Street and Sixth Avenue in SoHo.**Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade**. The morning of each Thanksgiving, one of the most famous parades in the world makes its way down Central Park West and winds through Midtown, broadcast on nationwide television each year and attracting millions of spectators who come to see the many elaborate floats, big-name performers, and (of course) the huge balloons of cartoon characters and pop-culture characters.\n\n**Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree**. Late in November or early in December, Manhattan rings in the start of the holiday season with the erection and lighting of a massive Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center, an event broadcast on television and attended by plenty of celebrities. But even if you miss the lighting, the tree remains lit through January 6.**Fashion Week**is a semi-annual event that is one of the premier fashion events in the world, where press and buyers gather to preview designs for the coming season. The spring show takes place the second week of February, while the fall show takes place in early September. The main event is held at Lincoln Center and is open by invitation only, although many showrooms display their designs in tandem with the main show.\n\n## Learn\n\n[edit]If you plan on staying in Manhattan for some time, there are many types of classes you can take, as you can imagine. The offerings are way too numerous and varied to cover here, but include continuing education and extension courses at famous institutions of higher learning like New York University, Columbia University, the New School, and the Juilliard School of Dance, Drama, and Music; classes and lectures at the 92nd St. Y and many other neighborhood organizations serving the community; cooking classes at any of several cooking schools in Manhattan; martial arts classes; yoga classes; and classes in religion at any of the numerous places of worship in the borough.\n\n## Buy\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\nNew York is the fashion capital of the United States, and is a major shopping destination for people around the world. The city boasts an unmatched range of department stores, boutiques, and specialty shops. Some neighborhoods boast more shopping options than most other American cities and have become famous in their own right as consumer destinations. Anything you could possibly want to buy is found in Manhattan.\n\nOf course, Midtown is the hub of shopping; home to **Fifth Avenue** with its numerous flagship stores (Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Cartier, Tiffany's, Niketown, Barnes & Noble, **Old Navy**, GAP, NBA Store, Versace, Gucci, Armani Exchange, **FAO Schwarz**, etc.) and perpetually mobbed with shoppers and tourists. Nearby is the massive **Bloomingdale's**, while over in the Theater District, \"The Largest Department Store in the World\", the flagship store of **Macy's**, covers an entire city block.\n\nIn the heart of the ultra-wealthy Upper East Side is **Madison Avenue**, the center of New York's haute couture, full of small shops selling fabulously expensive clothes, accessories, and housewares to people who can afford not to look at the price tag. Even if it's out of your price range, it's worth a visit just to gawk.\n\nDown in Lower Manhattan, **Canal Street** east of Broadway around Chinatown is the polar opposite of Madison and Fifth Avenues; a paradise for bargain hunters and people looking to buy counterfeit knock-offs of high-end clothes and accessories. If you want to impress people back home with the fake Louis Vuitton bag you got for $30, this is the place to go. Also look at the stores that line **Mott Street** between Canal and Chatham Square. Nearby is **NoLiTa**, which has become synonymous with avant-couture boutiques in charmingly dilapidated buildings. Some stores are so idiosyncratic that they appear not to sell anything at all, yet are perpetually crowded and passionately trendy.\n\nWest of Broadway, the former artists' colony **SoHo** is now a prime shopping destination, especially on the weekends, when the sidewalks of West Broadway, Prince Street, and Broadway become almost impassible. Be warned though that the boutique stores have mostly been replaced by high-end chain stores.\n\nNew York has hundreds of **records stores** scattered around the area. Also, though vinyl has disappeared from the shelves of regular record stores, many stores still sell used and new vinyl.\n\nIconic New York city **souvenirs** are available in most tourist spots and along pushcart stalls on the street. That said, it's far cheaper (~50% less) to purchase them from shops in Chinatown, near Canal Street.\n\n## Eat\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\nAlmost any type of food you can imagine and any cuisine you can name is available in Manhattan. With thousands of restaurants, delis, grocery stores, and street vendors throughout the borough, you can find an excellent meal at virtually any price point. Even Manhattan, with its high rents and reputation for expensive restaurants, offers plenty of opportunities for a good, cheap meal; it's just a matter of knowing where to look.\n\n### Street vendors\n\n[edit]Manhattan has many great street food vendors, from the ubiquitous hot dog carts on many street corners to more specialized fare. Just be wary of food stands close to major tourist attractions; carts in Times Square and its immediate vicinity often aren't very upfront about their prices and will charge a lot more than their fellows further away. Just walking a few blocks away is often all it takes to find something more affordable. Most carts serve lunch from about 11AM to 5 or 6PM in the evening and disappear after dark, so look for a cart near you, smell what's cooking, and enjoy a hot and often tasty lunch for a few dollars (a meal costs anywhere from about $2 to $8). Mornings, from about 6AM to 10AM, the streets are dotted with coffee carts that sell coffee, croissants, bagels, and Danish pastries and are good for a cheap breakfast: small coffee and bagel for a dollar or so. From 10AM to 7PM, many vendors sell lunch and dinner choices, including hot dogs, hamburgers, gyros, and halal food like chicken kabobs. Washington Square Park, Union Square, and Madison Square Park are frequent congregation points for food trucks and more notably excellent stands.\n\n### Street fairs\n\n[edit]There are many street festivals more or less centered around food, such as the Big Apple Barbecue Block Party in Madison Square Park; the celebration of Bastille Day, which occurs the weekend after July 14, on 60 St. between 5th and Lexington Avs.; the Taste of Chinatown festival; and the Ninth Avenue International Food Festival, which takes place on the first weekend after Mother's Day each year, and many run-of-the-mill street fairs. If you come across a street fair by chance, beware of the food vendors who make all their money at street festivals, because with a few exceptions, they are usually bad, and look for booths of food establishments from the area. If no sign is up with the location of the booth's store, you can ask the people at each booth where their store is; if it's far away or they don't know where it is, be wary.\n\n### Sitdown/takeout eateries\n\n[edit]Pizza-by-the-slice joints dot Manhattan and vary in quality, but usually offer a good on-the-go meal for cheap. A pricier but still quintessential New York meal is the deli sandwich, available from the many delis throughout the borough. A wide variety of Chinese options can be found in Chinatown and various other neighborhoods, there's the small Koreatown with some very good (but not necessarily cheap) restaurants, Washington Heights is the center for Dominican food, the East Village is full of Japanese eateries of various types, and part of Murray Hill is known as \"Curry Hill\" for its proliferation of Indian restaurants. Italian options can be found in virtually every neighborhood, although a higher number appear in the East Village and Greenwich Village (note that Italian restaurants in \"Little Italy\" on Mulberry St. between Canal and Broome are mostly for tourists and tend to be overpriced).\n\n#### Pizza\n\n[edit]There are pizzerias all over Manhattan, and while many of them aren't all that good, the general standard of pizza is much higher than in most of the rest of the United States. There are also at least two different kinds of New York pizza: The typical corner pizza parlors that have gas ovens and serve by the slice and the whole-pie sit-down places that serve even thinner-crust pizza that's baked very briefly at very high temperatures in coal-fired ovens.\n\nIf you want New York-style pizza, **Lombardi's** in Little Italy is regarded as the oldest pizzeria in town and continues to draw in big crowds of tourists, but **Patsy's** in East Harlem has long been regarded by connoisseurs as serving perhaps the purest example of plain New York-style coal-oven pizza (don't order any toppings, though, just the regular or fresh mozzarella pies). Greenwich Village is the center of pizza on Manhattan, home to not only **Joe's** — generally considered the best gas-fired New York-style slice in Manhattan — but also the classic coal-fired style at **John's** and **Arturo's**.\n\nSome other notable pizzerias include the eclectic **Co.** in Chelsea and quite a number of Neapolitan-style places, plus Roman-style at **Palà** on the Lower East Side.\n\n#### Jewish delis\n\n[edit]The unique food of the Jewish delicatessen has permeated the United States, but the pastrami you get at the supermarket in no way prepares you for the wonder of the juicy, hand-sliced pastrami at **Katz's**, on the Lower East Side. Sure, it's a huge draw for tourists, but New Yorkers go there every day, too, because it really is the genuine article. Another worthwhile deli, which also has what might be the best matzo ball soup in town and encompasses more *appetizing* (see below), like kasha varnishkes, is **2nd Avenue Deli**, in Murray Hill.\n\n#### Appetizing\n\n[edit]In most parts of the English-speaking word, \"appetizing\" is an adjective, but among New York Jews, traditionally, it was a noun meaning pareve treats that could be eaten at both dairy and meat meals. Fish is not considered a meat under the Jewish dietary laws of kashrut, so one of the pillars of appetizing in Manhattan is **Barney Greengrass**, the Sturgeon King, on the Upper West Side, with an honorable mention to the nearby **Zabar's**. The other pillar is **Russ & Daughters** on the Lower East Side. These are places to get lox, whitefish, herring, kasha, and a bunch of other things that are part of a way of life that may not be as vibrant as it was 100 years ago but can still be experienced in Manhattan.\n\n#### Cheesecake\n\n[edit]New York cheesecake is world-famous, and you can get some excellent cheesecake in Manhattan, even though some of it comes from the Bronx. Zabar's carries **S&S Cheesecake**, which comes from the other side of the Harlem River. However, **Eileen's** in NoLiTa is generally considered roughly on a par with S&S, and **Two Little Red Hens** on the Upper East Side is not too shabby and also sells great squares (lemon, lime/coconut, etc.).\n\n#### Bagels\n\n[edit]A lot could be said about bagels, and many folks on the Upper West Side who have experienced **Absolute'**s mini bagels right out of the oven in the morning will swear to you that they've never had anything better (others have their own favorites around town), but while a survey several years ago confirmed that ranking, a more recent article in a local magazine made the point that the most important factor in differentiating the quality of bagels at decent stores is whether you get them while they're hot. So your best bet is to find out who makes good bagels near you and get there early in the morning, or whenever they make another batch. And if you want traditional toppings, you can't get more classic than cream cheese and lox (see \"Appetizing\" above for places to get superior lox).\n\n## Drink\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\nManhattan nightlife is some of the most vibrant in the world. Thanks to the 4AM last call and over 800 active venues in Manhattan alone, it is no wonder that many people flock to New York as the city of good times.\n\nCertain neighborhoods are better than others for certain crowds but with New York the question is never whether you can find it, it's only where.\n\n**Greenwich Village**is probably the best neighborhood to go if you are in town for just a brief period. It's the equivalent somewhat of a Latin Quarter, full of locals of all ages, especially students attending NYU. There are many bars and jazz clubs around Bleecker Street and MacDougal, as well as near lower Seventh and Sixth Avenues.**Chelsea**– This was the old club capital of Manhattan, once known for its mega clubs which can hold hundreds upon hundreds of drunken revelers. Though a bit deserted, Chelsea still has a few nooks to look in for great nightlife. There's lots of clubs, a mix of bars, and a thriving gay scene along Eighth Avenue between 20th & 30th Streets. West Chelsea (27th-29th streets, west of 10th Avenue) is loaded with clubs. If you're European and looking for a discothèque, this is where you want to be.**The Meatpacking District**– Trendier bars and clubs and some expensive restaurants, including the Old Homestead, NYC's oldest steakhouse. Located between Greenwich Village and Chelsea, around 14th Street and 9th Avenues. Many of the clubs are very strict at the door so be sure you either have contacted a promoter or sweet talked to the doormen. Buying a table never hurts (except your wallet!). The Meatpacking District website is the best source of info on this area.**The Lower East Side**– Formerly the dingy alternative to the West Village, the Lower East Side has become trendier today. Ludlow Street is crawling with bars and small music venues in an area that may remind you of the Bastille in Paris. Rivington and Stanton Street are also viable options. The area has experienced an influx of hipsters.**The East Village**– You can't throw a stone in East Village without hitting a packed bar. All you need to do is go to 14th Street, head due east until you get to the letter avenues (Ave A, etc.) and head down any one of those to find yourself dead in the middle of the neighborhood scene. Try walking down 3rd Ave below 14th as well for a good tour of some of the area's bars. Down here you'll find a lot of divey, fratty bars so be prepared to drink keg beer and play Beirut! There's also lots of bars on Second Avenue around 2nd Street, and a sizeable cluster of Japanese bars, which are great fun, on St. Mark's between 2nd and 3rd.**Alphabet City**– East of the East Village, this area was once a dangerous drug-addled hell hole; today it is cleaned up and loaded with bars. Heroin dens have been replaced with brunch places!**Murray Hill**– More hip with the 30-year-old crowd. The area around 29th Street and Lexington Avenue has many Indian restaurants, but within three blocks there are plenty of watering holes, including a couple of fireman bars and an all Irish whiskey pub.**Times Square**– A very touristy area. The Marriott Marquis at Broadway & 45th has a revolving bar on the 50th floor. The Peninsula Hotel at 5th Avenue & 55th has probably the classiest rooftop bar in New York. The Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center is often closed and has a dress code. The Hotel Metro on 5th Avenue & 35th also has a rooftop bar with fantastic, stress free, views of the Empire State Building. Very few New Yorkers would be caught dead at these places. However, there are bars in Hell's Kitchen, further west on 9th Av., where you will find some New Yorkers.**Yorkville**– A semi-hidden gem that not a lot of downtown heads know about because it's so far uptown. If you hit 2nd Ave and walk from 90th St down through the upper 70s you'll see a nearly uninterrupted string of bars and restaurants. Take a walk that way; there are some great spots and all different kinds of bars from upscale to dive.\n\nIt can be quite daunting choosing a bar from the hundreds you have to choose from. If all else fails, ask a concierge or even someone in the street. There's bound to be something nearby.\n\n## Sleep\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\nIf there is one thing that makes New York City, particularly Manhattan, one of the most expensive cities in the world, it is hotel accommodations. Sometimes, the average room rates in Manhattan exceed those of the more expensive cities in the world such as Tokyo and London. Consider yourself lucky if you can get a room at a full-service hotel at $250/night, not including taxes. While prices vary depending on the season and on the availability, approximate price ranges for Manhattan hotels are:\n\n- A bed in a large dormitory in a hostel, between $15-40/night.\n- A double room with shared bath, between $60-120/night.\n- A double room with private bath in a budget hotel, between $100-250.\n- A room in a mid-range hotel, from $250 and up.\n- A room in a luxury hotel, if you need to ask ....!\n\nFor budget conscious travelers many new hostels have opened. While some, like Hostelling International – New York (in a landmarked historic building renovated in the early 1990s) and the many branches of the Jazz Hostels in the Upper West Side, East Village and Times Square have built a reputation for providing good value for money, many others are SRO (Single Room Occupancy) conversions where renovated hotel rooms share space with run down rooms for low income residents. It is best to research a budget hotel carefully before reserving a room. If you have a AAA membership, consider staying at a hotel that offers a discount. The 10% discount can add up over a few days.\n\nOccupancy rates in New York hotels are very high, and, especially if traveling to the city during Thanksgiving week, in the month of December, or in the month of May, it is best to book well in advance for the best prices. The best way to spend the night in New York is, of course, on the couch of a friend or relative. So, if you want to stretch your dollar, check your address book when planning a trip to New York! Another option is to check short-term room or apartment rentals on Craigslist, but of course it's risky to pay up front for an apartment you haven't seen, so you might want to spend at least your first day or two at a hotel or other place of more or less known quality while checking out possible alternate locations. Inexpensive short-term rentals of decent quality are likely to run for $100/night and up for a double.\n\nIn 2023, New York City implemented legal restrictions that disincentivize short-term rentals. Among other restrictions, stays of fewer than 30 days are limited to two guests, must be in locations with no internal door locks, and require that hosts be physically present during the stay. Any listings which obviously violate these restrictions are illegal and should be treated with appropriate caution.\n\nHotels in the other boroughs or New Jersey may be generally less expensive, but if spending a lot of time in Manhattan is important to you, make sure you know what the transportation situation will be like before you make your decision. Also, remember that complimentary meals are usually a disadvantage in hotels in New York, because with a few notable exceptions the better values in food tend to be outside of hotels.\n\n## Connect\n\n[edit]Throughout Manhattan, open WiFi access points are abundant, including many parks and squares such as Bryant Park and Union Square. All Starbucks branches offer free internet, and some stores such as Apple SoHo and Tekserv offer free wireless Internet to customers.\n\nAll of the many branches of The New York Public Library offer free internet access to anyone with a photo ID or NYPL library card.\n\n## Stay safe\n\n[edit]Manhattan and New York generally have experienced a major falloff in crime during the past 25 years, and there is no need to be afraid to walk most of the streets by day and until around 11 PM or midnight. Although there was a major increase in shootings in 2020 and 2021, plus several instances of people being pushed onto subway tracks, crime has again plummeted since then, and as of 2024, New York is again a remarkably safe big city by U.S. standards. That said, precautions should be taken.\n\n**Keep your wits about yourself**. Try your best to know or at least look like you know where you're going, particularly in areas which are deserted or otherwise feel potentially dangerous to you. Be aware of what's happening around you on the street, where the open shops are, where you may have spotted any police officers around, etc. Do not hesitate to calmly increase your pace, alter your route, or cross to the other side of the street if you sense it might be the safest course of action.\n\n**Beware of pickpockets**. During the holiday season, pickpockets like to target shoppers near tourist attractions such as Times Square, Grand Central Station, 42nd Street, and Macy's, and anywhere where there is a crush of crowds. In order to foil pickpockets, never put your wallet or anything of value in your back pockets, but only in your front pockets. If you use a purse, make sure it is tightly closed and hold on to it. And when you sit down, such as in a restaurant, be careful to keep your valuables in places where an opportunistic thief would be hard pressed to snatch them and run.\n\n**Traffic hazards**. Manhattan is in certain ways a pedestrian's paradise, but beware that traffic regulations are not always obeyed to the letter. Watch for aggressively turning cars and bicyclists, motorcyclists and people on scooters riding the wrong way on one-way streets or on sidewalks. Also, you'll note that jaywalking is commonplace among New Yorkers, but it can be hazardous to those not experienced in judging the speed of oncoming cars. So do not blindly follow a local, for there's a chance you'll be staring at the headlights of a car if you are not careful.\n\n**Bias crimes**. New York saw a sharp increase in bias crimes during the pandemic, with the largest increase in crimes against people who are or look Asian, including some terrible incidents in Manhattan. These are still a risk. Particularly if you're Asian, be alert if you are walking alone.\n\n## Go next\n\n[edit]Too many travelers probably spend all or too much of their time in New York solely on Manhattan; the island makes a great base from which to travel to one or more of the Outer Boroughs -- Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. You can also get great views of the Manhattan skyline from right across the Hudson River in cities in New Jersey like Hoboken, Weehawken, and Jersey City.\n\nRoutes through Manhattan (by car) |\n\nNewark ← Jersey City ← |\nW E |\n→ END |\nNew Haven ← Bronx ← |\nN S |\n→ Fort Lee → Philadelphia |\nSecaucus ← Weehawken ← Becomes ← |\nW E |\n→ Queens → Riverhead |\nKatonah ← Bronx ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nNew Haven ← Bronx ← |\nN S |\n→ Fort Lee → Philadelphia |\nAlbany ← Bronx ← |\nN S |\n→ Fort Lee → Cape May |\nEND ← |\nW E |\n→ Queens → Mineola |\n\nRoutes through Manhattan (by commuter rail) |\n\nEND ← |\nW E |\n→ Queens → Hicksville |\nWhite Plains ← Bronx ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nCroton-on-Hudson ← Bronx ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nEND ← |\nSW NE |\n→ Bronx → Stamford |\nDover ← Secaucus ← |\nW E |\n→ END |\nWoodbridge ← Secaucus ← |\nSW NE |\n→ END |\nHigh Bridge ← Secaucus ← |\nW E |\n→ END |"}
{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Brooklyn", "title": "Brooklyn", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "text": "**Brooklyn**, the \"Borough of Homes and Churches,\" is one of the five boroughs of New York City. It used to be a separate city, and still feels much like one. It has about 2.5 million inhabitants. If separated from the rest of New York City, Brooklyn would be the 4th most populous American city.\n\nBrooklyn is on the westernmost point of Long Island and shares a land boundary with Queens, which partially encircles Brooklyn to the north, east and south; Manhattan lies across the East River to the west and north of Brooklyn, and Staten Island is across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the southwest.\n\nBrooklyn is enjoying a period of growth and affluence not seen since before World War II. The Brooklyn Academy of Music boasts world-class theater performances, and the nearby Barclays Center is the home of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets. Coney Island's Luna Park is one of the attractions for summer crowds seeking fun during the New York summer heat. A wave of new skyscrapers is coming in as of 2025.\n\nDowntown Brooklyn has been undergoing extensive redevelopment and now boasts upscale boutiques, abundant public spaces, and the Brooklyn Bridge Park stretching along the waterfront and providing unparalleled views of the Manhattan skyline. Prospect Park, a national historic site, was even preferred by its designer Frederick Law Olmsted to his other creation, Manhattan's Central Park. Williamsburg has been named by *Forbes* magazine as one of *America's best hipster neighborhoods.* Midwood, Gravesend, Seagate, South Williamsburg, Crown Heights and Borough Park collectively have half of the NYC metro region’s Jews. Brighton Beach is home to New York's largest concentration of Russian immigrants, while the growing 8th Avenue Chinatown and Gravesend and Homecrest populations all paint a more authentic picture of New York's Asian community than their counterpart in Manhattan. However, despite these developments, Brooklyn is full of old gems, like family-owned brick-oven pizzerias, dive bars that seemingly haven't changed since the 1950s, and vast historical neighborhoods with buildings dating back to Dutch colonial times.\n\n## Districts\n\n[edit]Williamsburg Well known for its large artistic community, it is a diverse area with hipsters centered around Bedford Avenue, Orthodox Jews in South Williamsburg, a sizeable Polish population in Greenpoint, and a large Hispanic population and a growing arts community in Bushwick. |\n\nDowntown The main tourism district in Brooklyn, Downtown Brooklyn has majestic buildings, the Brooklyn Bridge, and an unparalleled view of the Downtown Manhattan skyline from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. |\n\nGowanus and Red Hook Red Hook is an artists' colony and was home to MTV's Real World Brooklyn cast. The nearby areas of Gowanus and Carroll Gardens are good places to explore some of Brooklyn's industrial history. |\n\nProspect Park Pretty brownstone houses, the Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, and more, all ringing Olmstead and Vaux's preferred park. |\n\nSouthwest Brooklyn The big attraction is the historic Green-Wood cemetery, one of the largest in New York and the final resting place of several notable people. Other attractions include New York's third Chinatown, and an Italian enclave in the west of Brooklyn (shown as Greenwood and New Utrecht on the map). |\n\nBedford-Stuyvesant and Flatbush The beating heart of Brooklyn is home to New York's largest African-American neighborhood, many West Indian immigrants, a large Orthodox Jewish community, mighty shopping streets, beautiful Victorian homes, and much of the classic history of Brooklyn. |\n\nConey Island and Brighton Beach Home to the fabled Coney Island amusement parks. The neighborhood has seen a rise in tourism with the opening of the Luna Park amusement park. Also home to New York's only aquarium, the Cyclones minor league baseball team, the original Nathan's restaurant, and one of the largest Russian-speaking communities outside the former USSR. |\n\nEast Brooklyn While certain neighborhoods in this section are pretty rough and this one is off the average tourist's radar (except for its proximity to JFK), this section has some attractions near Jamaica Bay. |\n\nThere is a variety of neighborhoods in Brooklyn.\n\n**Downtown Brooklyn**, which is the central shopping and business area, anchored by Fulton St. west of Flatbush Avenue, looks similar to the downtown of almost any other major American city, with department stores, clothing and electronic shops, Borough Hall, two universities, a major railroad station, the Brooklyn Academy of Music concert hall, many office buildings, and municipal, state and federal buildings and courthouses. Many subway and bus lines go to or through Downtown Brooklyn.**Brooklyn Heights**is a residential neighborhood with elegant buildings and historic churches. It is an expensive neighborhood to live in, partly because of its great views of the Lower Manhattan skyline. The area's brownstone buildings and shopping district give it a quaint yet thriving feel. This is the richest neighborhood in Brooklyn, more expensive than parts of Manhattan.**Canarsie**is a West Indian neighborhood with somewhat of a \"small-town\" feel, largely composed of 1- and 2-family houses. The major commercial streets are Flatlands Avenue, Rockaway Parkway and parts of Seaview Avenue. It is served by the Rockaway Parkway station on the L line.**Cobble Hill**is a quiet neighborhood of bookstores, shops, and restaurants. Old-time Italian neighborhood with great pizza and Italian ices. Great restaurants and quite a number of bars along Court St. and Smith St.\n\n**DUMBO**is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. Once popular with artists for loft space, it has now become popular with a richer, trendier crowd. Walk along the riverfront park for a unique and unforgettable view of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges and the Manhattan skyline.**Park Slope**— Long a haven for interracial families, lesbians and gays, and everyone else with a certain kind of groove in NYC, this upscale but downhome neighborhood can be joked about as the Berkeley of New York City. The granola eating transplant crowd might make you queasy at times and nostalgic for crackheads, but the neighborhood itself is beautiful. Boutiques, cafés, bars, health food stores like the 30-year-old Park Slope Food Coop, and attractive young people pushing strollers. Also home to a sizeable Lesbian community since the 1970s. Take the B or Q to 7th Ave, the M or R to 9th St, or the F or G to 4th Ave. or 7th Ave. and walk the neighborhood. Prospect Park is large, beautiful and green. Ice-skate here in the winter. Fly kites and enjoy free weekend concerts in the summer. While staying hip and vibrant, \"the Slope\" as it is commonly referred to, also enjoys its share of wealth. The quaint, tree-lined streets closer to the park house ornate, brownstones, townhouses, full service apartment buildings, and even a few full scale urban mansions on the parkside. These residences include the homes of names such as Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) and famed actors Jennifer Connelly, Steve Buscemi and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Check out 5th Ave. for the restaurants and bars.**Carroll Gardens**— Historians date the name to the 1960s, and real estate people like to enlarge its borders. It encompasses part of Smith St. and the nearby areas. In the 1950s and further back in time, this area was known as Red Hook, to the dismay of many, and it still is called both Red Hook and South Brooklyn by many people. Smith St. has a newly charged restaurant row, but there are still plenty of old school Italian-American gems to be found.**Williamsburg**— Take the L train from Manhattan to Bedford Ave. or Lorimer St. Many restaurants, several popular music clubs and a burgeoning art gallery district. It is now what Greenwich Village used to be - including the artsy scene complete with eclectic galleries and off-beat bars. Have dinner at Sea (North 6th St. & Bedford Ave.) and go to the Royal Oak for a drink (North 11th St. & Union Ave).**East Williamsburg**— Centered around the Morgan Ave. stop on the L train. Seemingly a desolate industrial area, this neighborhood has a strong developing music scene. It is also home to the swinger's club Grego's. Brooklyn's natural food store can be found here.**Bushwick**— Rich in its own history, Bushwick is home to many brownstones, mansions, and projects alike. It's a rapidly gentrifying, hip neighborhood, much like Williamsburg used to be, with popular clubs and hipsters added to a large working-class Latino community. Shopping can be done on Knickerbocker Avenue, whether for clothes, appliances, or food. The newly restored Maria Hernandez Park on Knickerbocker Ave. and Suydam St. is a nice spot to bring the kids and relax in the shade of the trees. While it's not like neighboring \"East Williamsburg,\" Williamsburg, or Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick has its own sense of community, not to be confused with anything else.**Prospect Heights**— Situated just north and northeast of Prospect Park, Prospect Heights features the Brooklyn Museum, which is first rate but often overlooked due to the museums in nearby Manhattan; a block away from the museum is the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Further west on Eastern Parkway are the Brooklyn Public Library and Grand Army Plaza, the southern point of which marks the main northern entrance to Prospect Park.**Red Hook**is a formerly bustling industrial area that is on the upswing. Although hard to access by train, it can be served by the F & G trains at Smith-9th Street or by taxi or by the B61 bus. Settled in 1636 by the Dutch, it has seen many a boom and bust is today caught between those who like it as the sleepy part of town that time forgot and those who seek to restore its crown as the Queen of Kings County Commerce. If you're looking for something off the beaten path, Red Hook is it. Many artists call Red Hook their home, so don't be surprised to see random sculptures, galleries, or creative gardens across from city housing or burned out buildings. It was also home to the MTV's Real World Brooklyn cast in 2007.**Cypress Hills**— A subsection of East New York. See East New York.**Fort Greene**has some great restaurants and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which features an art-house cinema, theater, and concerts.**Coney Island**— Ah, the famous Coney Island. Take the D, F, N, or Q trains to the end of the line to enjoy the beach or amusements or just get your official Nathan's hot dog. The Cyclone, a 1927 roller coaster, is the most famous of the amusement park rides at Coney Island, for good reason: It packs a lot of thrill into a small lot. There is also a great view of Manhattan from the top of the Wonder Wheel (a large Ferris wheel). Otherwise, the amusement park is somewhat seedy, which is part of its appeal.[dead link]**Brighton Beach**— The largest Russian-speaking community outside of the former USSR. It's unlike any other neighborhood in the city. It can be reached by the Q (local) or B (express) trains by going to Brighton Beach Avenue. Mosey on along the famous boardwalk and have a shashlik (shish-kebob) with a shot of vodka for lunch.**Bay Ridge**— Traditionally a residential Irish-Italian-Norwegian neighborhood, Bay Ridge has had an influx of Arab, Asian and Russian families as well. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge connects to Staten Island, and Fort Hamilton, a United States Army Base, is here as well. There is a great variety of good values in food to be had in this neighborhood, especially on 3rd Av. Also, it is one of the top bar areas in the non-downtown area of Brooklyn.**Sunset Park**— Called New York City's little Puerto Rico and Brooklyn's Chinatown. Sunset Park is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in New York City. Less than 20 min from downtown Brooklyn, Sunset Park is a place for all families to come and shop and run Irene's on the heart of Sunset Park, 5th Avenue between 60th and 44th Streets. Its hilly terrain gives magnificent views of Downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan, Staten Island, Jersey City and the nearby Verrazano Bridge. Besides the Hispanic part of the neighborhood, filled with families from Puerto Rican, Dominican, Mexican and other Hispanic descent, the Chinese also put Sunset Park on the map with countless Chinese restaurants found on 8th Avenue between 60th and 40th Streets.**Greenpoint**— At the northern tip of Brooklyn, Greenpoint is the second largest Polish enclave in the United States (after Chicago) but is also home to a sizable Latino population (north of Huron St.) and a growing number of hipsters (see Franklin St.). Get Polish food at Karczma (136 Greenpoint Av.), coffee at Ashbox (Manhattan Av. between Ash & Box Streets), brunch at Brooklyn Label (Franklin & Java), Mexican at Acapulco's (Manhattan & Clay). Lots of good Polish meat markets along Manhattan and Nassau Avenues, too. For some industrial chic, walk down Java Street to its dead end at the East River for great views of Midtown. Nearest subway: G train to Nassau Av. and Greenpoint Av. stations.\n\n**Flatbush**— Formerly a Jewish, Italian, and Irish neighborhood, and before that settled by members of the Dutch Reformed Church, and now a largely West-Indian neighborhood, it is the home of Brooklyn College. In the very center is the 18th- century Dutch Reformed Church at the corner of Flatbush and Church Avenues, and the original school house dating to 1787 and originally called Erasmus Hall, now the administration building of the public Erasmus Hall High School, its own building over 100 years old. The neighborhood's eponymous commercial main street, Flatbush Avenue, goes from the Manhattan Bridge on the north to the Gil Hodges Marine Parkway Bridge leading to the Rockaway Peninsula section of Queens on the south. Get there by taking the 2 or 5 trains to Church, Newkirk, or Flatbush Avenue.**Midwood**is a quiet residential area with some commercial streets, on the other side of the Brooklyn College campus from Flatbush and extending for some distance to the south. The neighborhood is ethnically mixed but includes a substantial population of Modern Orthodox Jews and some Chasidim, and many shops are closed on Saturdays and Jewish holidays. The area has one of New York City's largest concentrations of beautiful free-standing hundred-year-old Victorian and Edwardian homes. An interesting example is the Avenue H station house on the Q subway line, which was built a century ago as the local real estate office selling these homes. It is a historic site and a unique fixture among the city's subway system. (See The Little Station House in the Woods for more information.)**Sheepshead Bay**— Near the Coney Island amusement parks, this neighborhood is populated with many Chinese and Russian immigrants. There are piers along the bay on Emmons Avenue where anyone can pay a small fee to be taken out for a day of fishing. Includes restaurants along the Bay and the El Greco Diner. It is served by the B & Q trains.**Bensonhurst**used to be Italian, but is now home to Brooklyn's second Chinatown; it also contains many people from Albania, Pakistan, Korea, Mexico, Guatemala and many Eastern European immigrants as well. The train runs above ground, and it is a lively place with an Old New York feel. Many of the best \"unknown\" restaurants in Brooklyn (known locally but often ignored by the Manhattan-based establishment) can be found in Bensonhurst. Get there by taking the D or M train to 18th or 20th Avenue or Bay Parkway.**Crown Heights**is largely a mixture of West Indians and Chasidic Jews. Get there by taking the 3 or 4 trains to Utica Avenue. Part of the neighborhood is near the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens and the Brooklyn Museum. Violent crime is a still a concern along with the other social problems in the community so use caution.**Borough Park**contains the biggest Chasidic Jewish community in the city. You will see lots of kosher foods on sale and shops that are closed every Friday night and Saturday, because of religious rules, but open on Sunday. If these things are unfamiliar to you, a trip to Borough Park may be worthwhile.**Bedford-Stuyvesant**is a major African-American neighborhood with some African presence. It is served by the A and C trains at Nostrand Avenue. It is the second largest African-American neighborhood in the country after the city of Detroit. Bed-Stuy, as it is called by most New Yorkers, has been gentrifying lately. However, violent crime is a still a concern along with the other social problems in the community.**East New York**— like many Brooklyn neighborhoods it is rich in its own history with homes where farms once stood and its many parks like Highland Park where children can roam free to play. Gateway Mall is one of the few suburban-like malls in the city. The City Line subsection and Liberty Avenue are where residents can shop for food and clothing. But with the mall, parks and new homes popping everywhere come the projects. Like Brownsville, East New York is one of the most dangerous communities in New York City. Beware passing through here on your way to JFK Airport on the A and J trains and B15 bus.**Brownsville**is another mainly African-American neighborhood. It is just to the west of East New York, and like East New York, it remains among the more dangerous neighborhoods in New York, though crime statistics have declined, and does not merit a visit from most tourists. Beware passing through here on your way to JFK Airport on the B15 bus.**Kensington**is south of Prospect Park. It is the most diverse neighborhood in Brooklyn and is one of the most diverse in the United States. It is one of the \"up and coming\" neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Many new trendy restaurants and boutiques have opened, making this neighborhood a \"hotspot\" to reside in. It is served by the F and G trains at Church Avenue, the F at Ditmas Avenue, and the Q train at Beverly Road or Cortelyou Road.\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]The borough of Brooklyn is coterminous with Kings County—the counterpart of Queens County to the north—but hardly anyone calls it that except in occasional official correspondence.\n\nBrooklyn was once a separate city independent of the City of New York. The cities merged at the end of the nineteenth century, forever after lamented by Brooklynites as \"The Great Mistake of 1898.\" Although Brooklyn is very diverse, what makes Brooklyn so different from the other boroughs are its distinct cultural neighborhoods. Manhattan is frequently referred to as \"the city\" by residents of the other boroughs — for example, in the phrase \"I'm going to the city.\" Many Brooklynites have a great deal of pride in their borough, and most New Yorkers consider Brooklynites to have an identity distinct from that of other New Yorkers. In any case, remember while speaking to Brooklynites that referring to Manhattan as \"the city\" is acceptable but calling Manhattan \"New York City\" is not.\n\n### Visitor information\n\n[edit]- Brooklyn Tourism & Visitors Center, Historic Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon St, Ground Floor (at Court St; Subway: 2/3/4/5 trains to Borough Hall, M/R trains to Court St-Borough Hall, or A/C/F trains to Jay St-Borough Hall), ☏ +1 718 802-3846. M-F 10AM-6PM. Official tourist and visitor information center and gift shop with unique Brooklyn souvenirs.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]### By subway\n\n[edit]**From Manhattan**\n\nMost lines pass through Downtown Brooklyn and stop at Atlantic Avenue - Barclays Center, the largest subway stop outside Manhattan. From here, you can transfer between 2 3 4 5 B D N Q R and get to almost any destination in Brooklyn. You can also walk about two blocks north of the station to find Fulton Street G and Lafayette Avenue C stations. To use these, however, you have to pay another fare or have an unlimited rides card.\n\nFor northern parts of Brooklyn, the L crosses into Williamsburg and Bushwick, then continues further east. The J Z M lines will get you to those same neighborhoods but a bit further south.\n\n**From Queens**\n\nThere are four lines you can take to get directly from Queens to Brooklyn. The G snakes from Long Island City through Williamsburg and Downtown Brooklyn before ending near Prospect Park. Although it's seemingly the most direct route from Queens to Brooklyn, the service is notoriously slow and irregular, to the point where sometimes it's faster to get to Brooklyn through Manhattan. The A goes from the Rockaways in Queens, connecting with the JFK AirTrain at Howard Beach, and through the eastern edges of Brooklyn into Bedford-Stuyvesant and Downtown Brooklyn before continuing in Manhattan. The J Z go from Jamaica in Queens (accessible via AirTrain from JFK) into Bushwick and Williamsburg. The M travels from central Queens to Bushwick and Williamsburg, but on weekends its service terminates at Myrtle Avenue, requiring a transfer to the J for further service into Williamsburg and Manhattan.\n\n### By LIRR\n\n[edit]The Long Island Rail Road has a major station at Atlantic Terminal (Atlantic Avenue subway station), which is accessible from the Atlantic Avenue/Barclays Center subway station, served by the 2, 3, 4, 5 (on weekdays), B (on weekdays), D, N, Q, and R lines and near the Lafayette Avenue station of the C train and the Fulton Street station of the G train. Other LIRR stops in Brooklyn are Nostrand Av. at Atlantic Avenue (served by the A and C subway lines a few blocks away on Fulton Street) and East New York (served by the A, C, L, J, and Z a few blocks away at Broadway Junction and the L at Atlantic Avenue, though Broadway Junction is probably a safer bet). Eastbound trains continue to Jamaica Station in Queens, from where passengers can change to most LIRR lines for points further east or take the AirTrain to John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK). The LIRR no longer runs in Brooklyn during late nights (midnight to around 5AM), so to get to JFK from Downtown Brooklyn then, you have to take the A.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]Brooklyn is covered by an extensive network of MTA buses, for which a map is essential . The B39 travels over the East River on the Williamsburg Bridge between Manhattan and Brooklyn. Another route of note is the B15, which runs between JFK Airport and the Woodhull Hospital in South Williamsburg. Service on that route is provided around the clock. Possibly the longest mostly straight-line bus route in Brooklyn is the B41, which runs nearly the length of Flatbush Avenue from the line's northern terminal near Borough Hall just west of Flatbush Avenue itself to Kings Plaza at Avenue U (with a branch to the Mill Basin and Bergen Beach areas), about 9 miles away. Other long routes run a limited-stop service that stops at major intersections and points of interest. Limited-stop service is provided on the B6, B41, B44 (along Nostrand/Bedford Avenues), B46 (along Utica Avenue), and B35 (along Church Avenue). That pattern is in effect from around 6AM-10PM daily on these routes (5AM-11:30PM on the B46). The B49 has southbound limited-stop service on weekday mornings, mainly tailored for college students traveling to Kingsborough Community College. The B103 is a limited-stop route between Downtown Brooklyn and Canarsie, which runs on weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\n\nOne can also take express buses, with an X prefix, to/from Manhattan ($6.00 one way). Most express buses serve Southern Brooklyn, for the most part an area that's somewhat subway deprived, especially to the east. The X27 and X28 run daily from around 6AM-11:30PM. Other express routes run every day except Sunday and have a BM prefix.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]The connections between Queens and Brooklyn are too numerous to mention, because the two boroughs share a land boundary, so almost every street on the border just continues into the other borough. (Prior to 1990, the street signs in each borough had different colors, but they have since all become green - with the exception of brown signs for historic streets - and can no longer be useful in distinguishing between the boroughs.)\n\nThe Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges link Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge links Staten Island and Brooklyn. Only the Verrazano is a toll bridge. There is also a toll tunnel, the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, which links Brooklyn with the Battery (the southern tip of Manhattan).\n\n### By foot or bicycle\n\n[edit]All the bridges between Brooklyn and Manhattan are now accessible to both pedestrians and cyclists. Prospect Park's main road is closed to cars and open to bicycles. There are numerous bicycle paths in the park. Along New York Bay to the southwest, there are many sections where one can bicycle. Ocean Parkway also has a bicycle path that runs from Coney Island at the southern end of Brooklyn to the neighborhood of Park Slope.\n\n### By ferry\n\n[edit]The **Water Taxi**, at Fulton Ferry Landing, provides service from various points in Manhattan along the East River. The Water Taxi has service between southern Manhattan and Red Hook, often used by customers of the Red Hook Ikea.\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]### By subway\n\n[edit]The subway is overall the best way to get around Brooklyn, although there are some spots, notably Red Hook and parts of East Brooklyn (including most of the tourist attractions), where subway coverage is poor and bus transportation is encouraged. Using Google Maps transit directions is an easy way to get accurate directions throughout Brooklyn (as well as the rest of NYC). However, do check the MTA website for service changes, as Google Maps tends to miss out on those. You can also use the subway map on MTA website or pick one up for free at a station agent's booth.\n\nBrooklyn is well served by some 18 subway lines. The biggest hub is **Atlantic Avenue - Barclays Center**. There you may transfer to most subway lines in Brooklyn, 2 3 4 5 B D N Q R . In addition, the **Fulton Street** stop on the G line and **Lafayette Avenue** on the C line are close by, but require exiting and re-entering the subway system (only free if you have an unlimited ride Metrocard). **Broadway Junction** in Bed-Stuy and East New York is a minor hub between A C J L Z lines, which don't stop at Atlantic Avenue. Transferring there can be useful if you're going to Northern Brooklyn. **Coney Island** is a major hub for D F N Q lines—it's possible to do a \"loop tour\" of southern Brooklyn by changing there. For example, taking the D to Coney Island and then the F back to Downtown (both elevated lines) will provide great views of residential Brooklyn.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]Brooklyn has an extensive bus grid that proves very useful in accessing places where subway doesn't stop. The downside is that the buses are much slower than the subway (though not as slow as in Manhattan) and figuring out their route may be confusing. It's highly suggested to have a bus map handy (available free from any subway station agent) or to use Google Maps route planner, which incorporates bus directions very accurately.\n\nAs in the rest of New York City, some buses are limited (LTD) service, which means they skip certain stops along the route. However, even non-limited buses won't stop if the \"Stop Request\" light isn't on and no one is waiting at the bus stop (this is very common). If you plan to get off, make sure you press the \"Stop Request\" tape/button before you approach your stop, or else the bus may skip it.\n\n### By commuter rail\n\n[edit]There is the option of taking the Long Island Rail Road if your starting and ending points are in the following neighborhoods: Downtown Brooklyn, near Atlantic Avenue/Flatbush Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, near Atlantic Avenue/Nostrand Avenue, and East New York, near Atlantic Avenue/Van Sinderen Avenue. It isn't terribly convenient, due to the limited stops and relatively infrequent service, but if you need to go to exactly the areas it stops in, it's faster than the subway.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\n### Landmarks\n\n[edit]Downtown is where you'll find the one of the most famous of all New York landmarks: the **Brooklyn Bridge**, which connects the borough to Lower Manhattan.\n\n**Grand Army Plaza** marks the gateway to Prospect Park, and is home to the distinctive Soldiers and Sailors Arch.\n\nConey Island is a hotspot during the summer season. One could go for a day and enjoy the beach and beach vendors, then at night visit Luna Park and ride rides for a cheap price or watch a game at the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball field. Among the attractions is the **Coney Island Cyclone**, one of the world's oldest and still operating wooden roller coasters.\n\n### Museums and galleries\n\n[edit]Prospect Park is home to the **Brooklyn Museum**, NYC's second largest art museum. Downtown is home to the **New York Transit Museum**. Bedford-Stuyvesant and Flatbush are home to the **Brooklyn Children's Museum** and the **Jewish Children's Museum**, which is the largest Jewish-themed children's museum in the United States. Williamsburg is home to the **Hogar Collection**.\n\n### Parks and gardens\n\n[edit]**Prospect Park** was designed by Olmsted and Vaux, who also designed Manhattan's Central Park but preferred their Brooklyn creation. Adjacent to the park is the **Brooklyn Botanic Garden**, a 52-acre garden that is home to more than 10,000 taxa of plants. Both are covered in the Prospect Park district article.\n\n**Marine Park** is a public park that is in the Marine Park neighborhood and surrounds the westernmost inlet of Jamaica Bay. It has about 800 acres and has a bike path, handball court, shuffleboard court and playground. The park is mainly a fertile salt marsh that is supplied with freshwater from Gerritsen Creek.\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\n### Concerts\n\n[edit]The **Brooklyn Academy of Music** and **Bargemusic** in Downtown are both excellent options for concerts. During the summer season, Prospect Park hosts the **Celebrate Brooklyn** concert campaign every weekend in the Bandshell area of the park. There are also many concerts at churches and synagogues (for example in Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope), as well as at colleges (such as Brooklyn College and New York Technical College). Check the listings in newspapers like the New York Press and Village Voice, which also have websites.\n\n### Sports\n\n[edit]Coney Island is home to the **Brooklyn Cyclones**, the New York Mets' single-A minor league baseball team. In basketball, Brooklyn has been home to the NBA's **Brooklyn Nets** since 2012, and is home to the **New York Liberty** of the WNBA (women) in 2020. Both teams play in the Barclays Center in Downtown. The Cyclones' home of MCU Park is also home to **Rugby United New York**, a team playing in Major League Rugby, the top level of rugby union in the US and Canada.\n\n### Sightseeing\n\n[edit]There are a number of great places to walk for excellent views of Manhattan. Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge—or if you prefer, the Manhattan or Williamsburg Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge itself is beautiful, and the view is splendid. You can also walk along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade or under the Brooklyn Bridge into the DUMBO neighborhood to get amazing views of Manhattan overlooking the East River.\n\n- 1 Adventurer's Family Entertainment Center. ,\n- 2 Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, 3059 W 12th St, ☏ +1 718-372-2592.

Fancy gourmet restaurants to alleyway noodle shops, Malaysian to Vietnamese and fare from every Chinese province, the neighborhood has it all. Closest subway is the N-line's '8th Avenue' stop on 62nd and 8th.\n\nAlong **7th/5th Avenue** in Park Slope, one can find any type of cuisine from Italian, to Mexican, to Japanese and even Fish and Chips. This part of Brooklyn has plenty of Zagat-reviewed restaurants that are sure to please any type of craving and tastebuds.\n\n## Drink\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\n**Williamsburg**— This is the capital of NYC's hipster scene. There are plenty of bars along Bedford Avenue. Many of New York's small music venues are found here.**Bay Ridge**— This neighborhood has one of the highest concentrations of bars in the city! The neighborhood has been generally Irish/Italian and does not have the hipster/yuppie scene common in New York.**Park Slope**— This neighborhood is the yuppie capital of New York and you are more likely to find a tea house serving soy milk than a bar here. Young couples pushing strollers is a common sight. There is some low-key nightlife, although this has been on the decline. A number of lesbian bars are in this area.\n\n## Sleep\n\n[edit]*See the Districts articles for more listings.*\n\n## Stay safe\n\n[edit]Brooklyn may have a tough reputation, but it is largely safe these days. As a rule of thumb, use more caution as you get further east in the borough (especially beyond Utica Avenue), which is where the borough's two worst districts crime-wise are, East New York and Brownsville. You will likely pass through East New York on your way to/from JFK Airport on either the subway or the LIRR. Streets may be dangerous but trains and stations are generally safe, including transfers between subway lines at Broadway Junction, which has a transit police office if you're concerned.\n\nOther neighborhoods that one should exercise caution in are Bushwick, Red Hook (away from the waterfront), Coney Island (away from the amusement parks/beachfront), and East Flatbush.\n\n## Connect\n\n[edit]Public libraries, most restaurants, almost all hotels, and some public plazas have free Wi-fi, either for their customers or for the general public.\n\n## Go next\n\n[edit]Routes through Brooklyn |\n\nElizabeth ← Staten Island ← |\nW E |\n→ Queens → Bronx |\nEnds at ← |\nW E |\n→ Queens → Freeport |\nEND ← |\nW E |\n→ Queens → Splits into Babylon, Far Rockaway, and West Hempstead branches |"}
{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Queens", "title": "Queens", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Queens", "text": "**Queens** is a crescent-shaped (with a tail) borough traversing the north-to-south width of Long Island and including two of the major New York City area airports, LaGuardia (**LGA** IATA) and John F. Kennedy International (**JFK** IATA). It also carries the largest ethnic diversity in its area of any region in the world, with many small enclaves. Jackson Heights, for example, includes a huge Indian area, followed by a Colombian area, and then a Mexican area. Each offers a wide array of authentic shops, native-style cuisine, and festivals modified only slightly by the generally colder New York City experience.\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]The geographical center of New York City is in nearby Brooklyn, and Queens is home to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the site of the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs. The area around the park still includes an interesting museum and some architectural and artistic relics of the events (including the Unisphere, a 300-ton spherical grid of steel, the world's largest globe, as featured in \"Men In Black\"). The northern end of the old fairgrounds includes **Citi Field,** home of the New York Mets professional baseball team, and the **USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center,** home of the U.S. Open (tennis); further north one can walk along the edge of the marina along the **Long Island Sound**. The park also includes a science museum, a zoo, and pedal-boats, and hosts frequent special events.\n\n### Visitor information\n\n[edit]- Discover Queens Visitor's Center, 90-15 Queens Blvd (inside the Queens Center, Subway: M/R trains to Woodhaven Blvd), ☏ +1 718 592-2082, QueensVC@gmail.com. M-F 10AM-6PM, Sa Su 11AM-7PM.\n\n## Districts\n\n[edit]Queens has many distinct neighborhoods, some of which are ethnically diverse.\n\nLong Island City and Astoria Traditionally industrial, LIC is now home to a rising arts community. Astoria is known for its large Greek population, which is now accompanied by residents of diverse origins from four continents. Many trendy restaurants and shops are located in Astoria, with Steinway Street being a primary shopping district. |\n\nJackson Heights A large South Asian neighborhood with numerous Indian restaurants, groceries, and shops, including a Bollywood (Hindi film industry) theater, is centered around 74th St. and Roosevelt Av. The rest of the neighborhood is an incredibly diverse Latino community, with nationalities all the way from Mexico to Chile and Argentina represented. Other diverse neighborhoods, such as Woodside, with its famous Thai restaurants and Filipino markets, and Elmhurst, where almost every Southeast Asian community is represented, along with Chinese, Koreans, South Asians, and Latinos, are also included in this article. |\n\nFlushing-Northeast At the end of the 7 line is a very large and diverse Chinese community; important Korean and Indian communities are also to be found, further from the subway stop. |\n\nForest Park A large park in the center of Queens and the surrounding neighborhoods. |\n\nJamaica Transportation hub, primarily Black community, King Manor Museum, and unique cultural venues geared toward African American art. |\n\nThe Rockaways A popular summer resort area since the 1830s, The Rockaways have become a mixture of lower, middle, and upper-class neighborhoods. |\n\n## Get in & around\n\n[edit]### By foot or bicycle\n\n[edit]For information on how to **walk** or **bicycle** to and from Queens, check out the Transportation Alternatives website. Except for the Whitestone and Throgs Neck bridges, all the bridges can be crossed by pedestrians and bicycles. Be prepared, however, for long walks, as Queens is big and many neighborhoods are not well-designed for a walking tour. A map is necessary, and one of the best is available for free at any bike shop.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]Sadly, most Queens visitors spend their visit on a bus to or from LaGuardia Airport or JFK. A proper tour of Queens is worthwhile. It can be conducted by a stalwart driver; others may find the roads tough to navigate.\n\n### By subway\n\n[edit]A lot of Queens can be seen by subway. A trip on the 7 train, made nationally famous by the contempt of former Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker, is a cultural experience in and of itself. The 7 runs elevated through most of Queens, so you'll be able to get a good sense of much of the borough through its windows. A good tour of Queens should include at least three meals in three different ethnic enclaves.\n\nOther subways for getting around (and in and out of) Queens include the A, E, F, G, J, M, N, Q, R, and Z.\n\n### By Long Island Rail Road\n\n[edit]The Long Island Rail Road makes several stops in Queens: the main line runs through central Queens and the Port Washington line runs along the north shore (including a stop in Flushing).\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]Express buses stop in places in eastern Queens and the Rockaways, usually in places where the subway doesn't stop. Main arteries for express buses (that are closer to Manhattan) are Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard.\n\nLocal buses that go to Queens from Midtown Manhattan include the Q32, Q60, and Q101. The M60 goes from upper Manhattan from LaGuardia Airport.\n\nThe Q48 is a great bus for going to eastern Queens from LaGuardia Airport. It leaves you at the Flushing-Main Street station. Other buses from LaGuardia Airport include the Q33 and Q47 to the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue subway station, the and the Q72 to the Rego Park and Junction Boulevard subway stations.\n\nThe Q10 and Q3 go from JFK Airport. The Q10 goes to Lefferts Boulevard and serves the A train, J/Z trains, and E/F train subway stations. The Q3 goes out towards eastern Queens and goes into Northern Jamaica to the 179th Street F station.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]Queens is quite diverse in density and character. While western Queens (closer to Manhattan) is urban, much of eastern Queens is relatively suburban. As in every borough, the closer you get to Manhattan, the rarer it is to find a stand-alone house. The more urban clusters are in the northwest: Astoria and Long Island City (LIC). LIC also contains Queens' most prominent skyscrapers, including the \"other\" Citibank building, located directly across the East River from the more prominent angled-roof skyscraper in Manhattan. Rising 50 stories, the building, the result of Citibank's attempt to create a new business district in LIC, is the tallest building in New York State located outside of Manhattan.\n\nThere are a number of museums in Long Island City and Astoria, including the **Isamu Noguchi Sculpture Museum** in Noguchi's former sculpture studio, the **Museum of African Art**, **Sculpture Center**, and the **Museum of the Moving Image** which includes interactive exhibits on the history of video games. The area also includes a free place to view art, **Socrates Sculpture Park** which overlooks the East River and is next to Costco on Vernon Blvd.\n\nA general tip on NYC Museums: if you work for a large company such as IBM, GE, or Citigroup, check to see if your company is a member -- this goes for all museums in NYC; different museums have different sponsors of course.\n\nIn Flushing Meadows Corona Park (also on the 7 line; exit at Shea Stadium), the **Queens Museum** offers visual art, cultural events, Worlds' Fair Memorabilia, and a sprawling scaled-down Panorama of the entire city. It's incredibly accurate, except they've yet to remove the World Trade Center.\n\nJust off Northern Blvd in the area between Astoria and L.I.C, at 35th Avenue and 36th street, you'll find the **Museum of the Moving Image**, which showcases movies and the televisual arts, including video games, with revolving exhibitions. Kaufman-Astoria Studios (home of the Sesame Street, among others) stands next door; there's also a gigantic movie theater, and a nice new 24-hour diner/bar (which serves pitchers of beer) known as *Cup*. Take the R/V/G or the N/W line.\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]- Watch a\n**New York Mets**game at**Citi Field**- Flushing - Go to the\n**U.S. Open**tennis tournament at the**USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center**in Flushing. - You can also visit the beach without leaving Queens, as the Ramones put it, \"we can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach.\"\n**Rockaway Beach**(on the Atlantic Ocean) is actually a fine stretch of relatively unpolluted sand on a narrow peninsula linked by bridge (bicycle accessible) and the subway (A train) to the rest of Queens (it can also be reached by road from Nassau County, Long Island, and by bridge from Brooklyn). Aside from the still-visible Empire State Building, and the frequent planes landing at nearby John F. Kennedy Airport, it is perhaps the most pastoral experience in New York City. The cleanest beach on Rockaway can be found at**Jacob Riis Park**, part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. Women can legally go topless at any public New York beach, although not very many do.*Note: Jacob Riis is a federal beach and subject to different laws than the rest of the Rockaways.*\n\nVisit farmers markets at:\n\n- New York Hall of Science Farmers Market. 111th St and 48th Ave off Corona Ave. Wednesday, 10AM-3:00PM, June to November.\n**Queens Botanical Garden Farmers Market**at Queens Botanical Garden off of College Point Blvd. and Blossom St - Flushing. Friday, 8:30AM-4:00PM, June to November.[dead link]- Jamaica Farmers Market. 160th St. off Jamaica Ave. Friday and Saturday, 8:30AM-4PM, June to November.\n\n## Buy\n\n[edit]- There are many sari stores in Jackson Heights, centering on 74 St. north of the subway stop.\n- There are many excellent Chinese supermarkets and smaller food markets in Flushing.\n- You can find lots of good shopping for discounted clothes along Steinway in Astoria (R train) and along Jamaica Avenue in Jamaica (E train).\n- There is a mall at 90-15 Queens Blvd with dozens of stores and a decent cafeteria.\n\n### Records\n\n[edit]As New York City is the birthplace of hip-hop culture, there are hundreds of records stores scattered around the boroughs, and some are in Queens. Also, though vinyl has disappeared from the shelves of regular record stores, many stores still sell used and new vinyl.\n\n## Eat\n\n[edit]The snobby feel of Manhattan may not always make it to Queens, which is one of its great appeals for those who live there. There are a few top-notch bars in Queens, but it's the restaurants that really shine, for a simple reason: If Manhattan food is Yuppie food, Queens food is created by and aimed towards genuine ethnic inhabitants. To put it another way, come here if you like spicy food. If you want a real taste of Hong Kong--or Tibet, Indonesia, Colombia, Peru, India, Argentina, or just about anyplace (including France)--you'll find it in Queens.\n\nSuggested general areas for culinary roving:\n\n**Flushing**for Taiwanese, Chinese and Korean (**Fay Da**on Main St., among others, offers reliably good Dim Sum). (The 7 line ends in Flushing - Main St., and you'll think you've gone all the way to Hong Kong). If you're driving, you'll notice an endless selection of Korean restaurants along Northern Blvd as you move in the direction of Nassau County. For more recommendations, see the Flushing guide.**Woodside**near 61st St is home to the Thai restaurant widely considered the best in New York,**Sripraphai**, 6413 39th Av. near Roosevelt Av. and 65 St, (718) 899-9599. You can access it via the 7 local or express at 61 St. or the Long Island Railroad's Woodside station in the same location. Also in Woodside is the Filipino barbecue restaurant**Ihawan**, 40-98 70th St near Roosevelt Av., (718) 205-1480. Quite popular with Filipinos & non-Filipinos alike for pork BBQ. Can be especially busy during holiday weekends.**Jackson Heights**near 74th street for Indian and Afghan. There are more than a dozen South Asian restaurants in the Little India section of Jackson Heights. Try the**Jackson Diner**or**India Taj**a few feet north on 74th from Roosevelt Ave. (E and F express trains as well as concurrent lines stop there, as does the 7 local).**Jackson Heights**near 82nd and 90th Sts. (take the 7 local to either of those stops) for Colombian, Peruvian, Ecuadorian, and Mexican.**Pollos A La Brasa Mario**has branches in many Queens locations, and two here (one is at 83rd and 37th Ave; there's also a flagship closer to 81st street on Roosevelt).**Elmhurst**offers great Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian, Thai, and Indonesian food. Try**Pho Bang**if you like Vietnamese (there are also other Queens branches, including one in Flushing on Kissena Blvd).**Penang**(Malaysian), which has branches in many U.S. cities, is located in the same complex on Broadway, just beside the LIRR bridge.- In the\n**Middle Village/Ridgewood/Maspeth**region (near the end of the M line) you'll find Rosa's Pizza (one is at Fresh Pond Rd. and Metropolitan Ave.; another is down Metropolitan Ave. at the end of the Middle Village strip). This is one of the great undiscovered pizza parlors of Queens. It also has branches in several locations. - Fancier food can be found in\n**Forest Hills**, including**Nick's Pizza**on Austin St, which is fine brick oven-style chow. In the basement of the hotel at station square (right in front of the LIRR stop) you'll find Bartini's, a small lounge offering 1,000 different martinis. Take the E or F express trains to 71st-Continental Av.\n\n**Astoria**offers great Greek and Czech food, as well as some of the hipper bars and diners in Queens, (you're right next to the movie studios).**Kabab Cafe**at 25-12 Steinway St is a great spot to go for Egyptian food.**Mombar Egyptian Restaurant**is an Astorian institution. Remember the address 25-22 Steinway St as there is no sign. Then again, a sign isn't necessary when you can recognize a stunning and ornate tile work framing the door. It was completed by Mombassa himself. His brother owns Kabab Cafe. Also along Steinway Street's Egyptian corridor near Astoria Boulevard is**Sabry's**, which serves some of the most delicious and fresh fish and shellfish in the entire area, all at a fraction of Manhattan prices.**Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden**is somewhere to definitely check out during the summer. This Czech beer garden and cultural center is swarmed over the summer with crowds enjoying the huge back patio filled with picnic tables. There is food served until about midnight. During the year, the center also holds various cultural events.**Tokyo 1**located at 3105 24th Avenue (near 31st street) is a Japanese restaurant that has good and cheap sushi.**Los Amigos**is a Mexican restaurant just beneath the Ditmars Avenue stop on the N train. It's on 31st Street. They have very good food and drinks.\n\n- If you just want a hamburger, you'll find the\n**Jackson Hole Diner**along Astoria Blvd between Jackson Heights and Astoria, just west of LaGuardia airport. This is a real diner (formerly the Airport Diner as seen in \"GoodFellas\") converted to suit Jackson Hole (another NYC-only chain). Jackson Hole burgers are good, although they need salt. Imagine a half-pound hockey-puck-shaped meatloaf and you're pretty close. But unlike a hockey puck would taste, this tastes good. - There's some fine dining to be had in\n**Hunters Point**, or so it's said, just southwest of Long Island City. Spacious riverfront restaurants appear here and there in the warehouse zone. It would be wise to drive or take a taxi. - Along Cross Bay Blvd in\n**Howard Beach**you'll find**Captain Mike's**, what appears to be a converted yacht now selling crabs, shrimp, and beer (dine at the bar or take it home; summertime only). **Corona**is home to an Italian and Hispanic community and the famous \"Lemon Ice King of Corona\". A favorite place for Mets fans to stop after the game, the corner shop offers over 20 flavors of ices including cantaloupe, watermelon, rum raisin, licorice, pistachio, pina colada and peanut butter.\n\n## Drink\n\n[edit]If you like bubble tea with sago and tapioca, there are several good spots within a few blocks of the Flushing-Main St stop on the 7 train. One of the best is on the corner of Main St. and 39th Av.\n\nQueens is home to one of the most entertaining and pleasant places to sip a brew, the Bohemian Hall (known citywide simply as \"The Beer Garden\"), near the Astoria Boulevard subway stop. This bar, popular in the summer, covers an entire city block, is walled and filled with trees, indoor and outdoor picnic tables and a cool crowd, and serves great Czech and German beer. Drink ales by the pitcher at wooden picnic tables under leafy canopy, surrounded by hundreds. 29-19 24th Avenue, just west of 31st Street. N/W to Astoria Blvd.\n\nWoodside is home to an Irish population and is loaded with bars and cheap happy hours, as well as drinking festivities before a Mets baseball game. There are several Irish pubs by the Woodside train station. Check out the burger at Donovan's.\n\n## Parades\n\n[edit]Every first Sunday in March, there is the **St. Pat's for All Parade** in Sunnyside and Woodside. The parade route begins at 43rd Street and Skillman Avenue and ends at Woodside Avenue and 60th Street.\n\nYou can take the M60 or Q32 bus from Manhattan or Western Queens to get to the starting route of the parade.\n\nThere is also the **Three Kings Parade** on January 3. The parade stretches across Northern Boulevard in the neighborhoods of Corona and East Elmhurst.\n\n## Sleep\n\n[edit]There are a number of hotels in Flushing that serve LaGuardia Airport, including a Sheraton. There are also many hotels near Kennedy Airport in Jamaica, but the location is generally considered undesirable for visitors, except for its proximity to the airport. Some hotels in Jamaica are listed as three stars but are nevertheless poorly kept. Other hotels are scattered through Kew Gardens, Forest Hills, Elmhurst, Long Island City, and various other neighborhoods.\n\n## Stay safe\n\n[edit]Queens doesn't have any really dangerous neighborhoods anymore, though of course you should not put down your guard completely and should continue to do sensible things like use only your front pocket for valuables and keep your wits about yourself.\n\nBut that said, the most dangerous thing you may do is cross Queens Boulevard, nicknamed the Boulevard of Death because of the number of people who've been killed trying to cross this broad thoroughfare which, though not a controlled-access highway, is a major artery where drivers tend to drive fast. Some measures were taken in the 2010s to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists on this boulevard, but you should still exercise special caution when crossing.\n\n## Connect\n\n[edit]Unlike in the rest of New York, addresses in Queens include the neighborhood rather than the borough (e.g., Flushing, NY; Woodside, NY).\n\n## Go next\n\n[edit]Routes through Queens (by car) |\n\nElizabeth ← Brooklyn ← |\nW E |\n→ Bronx → Merges into N |\nSecaucus ← Becomes ← Manhattan ← |\nW E |\n→ Plainview → Riverhead |\nNew Haven ← Bronx ← Becomes ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nEND ← Manhattan ← |\nW E |\n→ Floral Park → Mineola |\nEnds at ← Brooklyn ← |\nW E |\n→ Valley Stream → Freeport |\n\nRoutes through Queens (by commuter rail) |\n\nEND ← Brooklyn ← |\nW E |\n→ Splits into Babylon, Far Rockaway, and West Hempstead branches |\nMerges with Atlantic Branch ← |\nW E |\n→ Lynbrook → Babylon |\nMerges with Atlantic Branch ← |\nN S |\n→ Valley Stream → Queens (Far Rockaway) |\nEND ← Manhattan ← |\nW E |\n→ Floral Park → Hicksville |\nMerges with Main Line ← |\nSW NE |\n→ Manhasset → Port Washington |\nMerges with Atlantic Branch ← |\nW E |\n→ Malverne → West Hempstead |"}
{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_The_Bronx", "title": "The_Bronx", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "text": "The **Bronx** is one of the five boroughs of New York. Known for Yankee Stadium, the home field of the New York Yankees baseball team, it has been a borough of New York City since 1898. The vast Bronx Zoo houses hundreds of species of animals. Nearby, the sprawling New York Botanical Garden features a landmark greenhouse with rainforest and cactus displays. By the Hudson River, Wave Hill is a landscaped public garden with wooded paths and a cultural center.\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]The Bronx, often abbreviated as BX, and nicknamed \"The Boogie Down\", with a population of 1,472,654 (2020), is the only New York City borough on the mainland of the United States. It was originally part of Westchester County but was gradually annexed by New York City. The Bronx was completely incorporated into New York City in 1898.\n\nThe Bronx is the only borough with “the” as part of its name. This is because in the early 1600s, a Dutch settler, Jonas Bronck, bought the land from the Native Americans who occupied the territory at the time. Whenever other land owners in the area wanted to travel to that area, they would call it “The Bronck’s Land.” At first, he planned to use the land to grow tobacco crops, but it was too hilly and had marshy terrain.\n\nIn time, the Bronx changed the spelling of its name, and flourished into an area with a vibrant and diverse culture.\n\nThe Bronx has a strong character all its own. It is the birthplace of hip hop music and home to one of the country's most storied professional baseball teams, the New York Yankees, also known as the \"Bronx Bombers.\" Many ethnic groups have called the Bronx home over the years. Arthur Avenue is still a center of Italian American culture in New York, and many claim it has a more authentic feel than Manhattan's Little Italy. The South Bronx is a center of Puerto Rican culture and life, with a growing Mexican community as well. University Heights and Morris Heights are largely Dominican neighborhoods, while Woodlawn maintains a large population of Irish immigrants.\n\nWhile the southern and central Bronx are mostly comprised of apartment buildings and densely built, the physical environment of the Bronx is much more varied than what is normally portrayed in the popular media. For instance, Riverdale is a residential neighborhood of mostly detached single family homes located on bluffs overlooking the Hudson River. It looks more like a quiet suburb than the \"big bad\" Bronx. Bronx Park and Van Cortlandt Park are two large and notably tranquil green spaces. City Island, located in Long Island Sound but officially part of the Bronx, reminds people more of a small New England fishing village and is worth a visit. And there is a traditional downtown area called \"The Hub\" at 149th Street and Third Avenue. While not as large or extensive as the downtowns of major American cities, many larger stores are in that area and it is more than just a neighborhood shopping district.\n\nGeographically, the Bronx has a lot of hills. It is possible to stand on a street corner and look way down over a cliff toward the elevated train line that is itself 30 feet (9m) above ground. Many streets, especially in the West Bronx north of Yankee Stadium, have sections with steps instead of sidewalks and pavement, similar to San Francisco.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]### By subway\n\n[edit]The Bronx is directly connected to Manhattan by the 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , B , and D subway lines. Further extensions of these (with the exception of the 1 and 6 ) can be found in Brooklyn.\n\n### By rail\n\n[edit]The Harlem, Hudson, and New Haven Lines of the Metro-North commuter railway, which originate in Grand Central Terminal make various stops in the Bronx.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]Express buses run from Midtown Manhattan (except for the BxM18, which runs from lower Manhattan during rush hours) to various parts of the Bronx, and are a better bet than a taxi. Local MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) bus connections with Upper Manhattan and parts of Queens also exist.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]It is possible to drive across one of the many bridges from Manhattan or the three bridges from Queens, and points north are accessible via several highways (including I-87, Bronx River Parkway, Hutchinson River Parkway, and I-95.\n\n### By taxi\n\n[edit]Taxis from Midtown or Lower Manhattan can be very expensive.\n\n### By foot\n\n[edit]Pedestrians can cross any of the bridges that connect Manhattan with the Bronx.\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]The Bronx has good subway coverage but all lines are mainly north to south, with the subway lines designed more for access to Manhattan than crosstown travel in the Bronx, and many of its bus lines are slow and overcrowded at times. Many people who need flexibility in getting across the Bronx drive; however, the notorious overcrowding on the Cross-Bronx Expressway sometimes reduces such crosstown travel to a standstill.\n\nAnother option is Metro-North Railroad. It only serves limited sections of the Bronx, but those tend to be the areas without subway service. (There is the Hudson Line in the West Bronx, and the Harlem Line in the central section of the Bronx.) The fares are higher than the subway, and the trains don't run as frequently, but they offer less crowding. On the weekends, a \"CityTicket\", which allows a trip within the city boundaries, costs $5.00. In general, with sufficient planning and time, you can enjoy the borough through a combination of subway and bus travel and walking. A bus map can be found here.\n\nIf you happen to be staying in or venturing to the southeast Bronx, consider taking a NYC Ferry to the Soundview (connections to buses Bx39 and Bx27) or Throgs Neck docks (free parking) for a more unique experience than riding the subway underground (you'll do plenty of that in NYC). Along this Soundview route (SV), you will get a unique view from the East River: Manhattan, Hell's Gate, Roosevelt Island, Queens, and Brooklyn. If the salt water views are making you thirsty, grab a drink at the ferry's snack bar. Stops include East 90th St., E. 34th St., Stuyvesant Cove, and Wall Street. The entire route is approximately 56 min. The fare is a flat $4 with free transfers to other ferries for 120 minutes. Check the official NYC Ferry website for current maps and schedules.\n\nSeparated bikeways connect Pelham Bay Park in the east through Bronx Park in the central Bronx and Van Cortlandt Park in the west. Street bike lanes go most everywhere.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]- 1 Bronx Zoo, 2300 Southern Blvd (can be easily accessed from the 2 & 5 trains at West Farms Square/E Tremont Av, E 180th St, or Pelham Pkwy-White Plains Rd), ☏ +1 718 367-1010.

Some highlights are the Bertine Block, the Mott Haven brownstones found along Alexander Ave and just east of Willis Ave on 139th-141st Sts., and the Longwood Historic District.\n- 14 City Island (Bx29 bus from the Pelham Bay Park 6 station). An island in the Long Island Sound, the City Island has a very different feel from the rest of the Bronx or New York City. It\n*almost*has a New England fishing/boating village vibe, with many sailboats. You wouldn't believe you were still within the city limits of New York. The island is chockablock with seafood restaurants. The restaurants are not noteworthy, but the atmosphere is. Has a good nightlife. - The Bronx includes the\n**\"real Little Italy\"**in New York, centered on**Arthur Avenue**near East 187th Street. Good shopping in Italian foodstuffs is to be had in that neighborhood. Take the B D or 4 trains to Fordham Road. Transfer outside of either station to the Bx12 bus to Arthur Avenue.

The**Mott Haven**neighborhood ( 5 to 138 St./Grand Concourse or the 6 to 138 St./3rd Ave.) is the center of this development. Weird and mind-bending to long-time New Yorkers, it might be an interesting neighborhood for you to walk around.\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]### Sports\n\n[edit]- 1 Yankee Stadium, 161st St and River Ave (Subway: B D & 4 at 161st Street-Yankee Stadium.

The old Yankee Stadium, \"The House That Ruth Built\", is no longer in use, and has been replaced by the new Yankee Stadium across the street. The site of the old stadium is now\n**Heritage Park**, a large baseball and softball field that has a few nods to the old ballpark, like markers in the sidewalk paying tribute to the history of the old stadium and a section of the frieze from the old park. The current stadium has strict security policies, and as such backpacks and camcorders are not allowed inside (only bags under 14\" permitted).**Monument Park**behind center field pays homage to the great, Yankee legends of baseball; it officially closes 45 minutes before game time, but is oftentimes closed sooner if the crowds are large enough. If visiting Monument Park is a priority, best bet is to arrive close to when the gates open. Game tickets are expensive (many go for over $100) and should be bought far in advance. Stadium tours are also available for $20. - Riverdale Equestrian Centre, ☏ +1 914 633-0303. Offers guided horseback rides through Central Park, but you must already be at an advanced riding level.\n\n### Events\n\n[edit]The Bronx has many exciting events and celebrations that occur throughout the year.\n\n- Sunday Market, 660 W 237th St. Early Aug-Nov: Su 9AM-2PM.

Now those days are far behind. The crime rate declined by 71% from 1993 to 2010 and New York City police and fire departments continue to protect the residents from criminal activity and fires.\n\nMake sure you have a map or a destination in mind before heading out to explore the Bronx. Most of the neighborhoods in the Bronx are well-lit and safe and you can venture out to some of the best restaurants in New York City.\n\nYou can decrease your chances of trouble by following these tips:\n\n- Always remain in populated well-lit areas.\n- Don't interact with anyone who appears mentally unstable or somewhat menacing.\n- Don't leave important travel documents unsecured in hotel rooms.\n- Only use ATMs at reputable banks. When using ATMs outside, be very aware of surroundings and quickly put away cash. Avoid using independent, non-bank ATMs found in delis or stores.\n- During late nights, be wary of riding in empty subway cars, and select the car with a conductor present if possible.\n- Avoid buying tickets from anyone on the streets, unless you really know what you're doing, as many are counterfeit.\n\n## Connect\n\n[edit]**The New York Public Library**, one of the largest public libraries in the world, offers free Wi-Fi at each location. In addition, you can use their computers for free, but you must register beforehand. These are the locations in the Bronx:\n\n*Note: All locations are wheelchair accessible unless specified.*\n\n- Allerton Branch, 2740 Barnes Ave, ☏ +1 718 881-4240.

{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Staten_Island", "title": "Staten_Island", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Staten_Island", "text": "**Staten Island** is New York City's \"Forgotten Borough\" across New York Harbor from Manhattan. Staten Island may seem like it's in an entirely different world than the hustle and bustle expected in New York City. However, it still has some of the features you've come to expect from the city. This combination of city influences and its rural origins have created a unique borough that is a great place to visit.\n\n## Districts\n\n[edit]Staten Island has numerous neighborhoods, each with a distinct feel and different attractions.\n\nThese neighborhoods can be grouped into three regions: North Shore, Mid-Island, and South Shore. The North Shore includes the area north of the Staten Island Expressway. The South Shore generally includes the area south of the Fresh Kills. The Mid-Island takes up the area in between.\n\n### North Shore\n\n[edit]The North Shore is full of older neighborhoods, which were fully developed long before the rest of Staten Island. Thanks to this, many examples of old architecture can be found here. Its neighborhoods include:\n\n**St. George**– St. George is the political center of the Island, the location of its Borough Hall and County Courthouse. It is also a transportation hub, with the St. George Ferry Terminal, and a cultural center, with many attractions. These include the Staten Island Museum, the*Postcards*September 11 memorial, and the St. George Theater.**Tompkinsville**– A number of ethnic restaurants can be found here in Staten Island's \"Little Sri Lanka\".**Stapleton**– This small waterfront neighborhood is known for just that: its waterfront. Sometimes known as the Stapleton Homeport, this stretch of water almost became a United States Navy base, a plan that ended due to lack of funding. Today it is mostly residential housing; however, it is still used as part of the annual New York City Fleet Week.**Clifton**– A section of this neighborhood is called**Little Liberia**. It is home to the largest Liberian population in the world outside of Liberia.**New Brighton**– This small neighborhood just to the west of St. George can be characterized through its main attraction–the Snug Harbor Cultural Center. Once a retirement home, Snug Harbor is now a collection of museums that showcase the best of Staten Island's culture.**West New Brighton**– This neighborhood is a separate entity from New Brighton. It is home to the Staten Island Zoo.**Port Richmond**– One of Staten Island's oldest neighborhoods, Port Richmond is home to many examples of beautiful architecture.**Mariners Harbor**– This neighborhood began as a fishing village, and is now a minor center for shopping.**Silver Lake**– This neighborhood is dominated by the lake and park of the same name. A popular place with the locals, Silver Lake is the largest body of water on Staten Island.**Grymes Hill**– Grymes Hill is home to a number of colleges, including Wagner College and St. John's University Staten Island Campus.**Willowbrook**– This large neighborhood has a peaceful vibe to it. It is home to Willowbrook Park and the College of Staten Island.\n\n### Mid-Island\n\n[edit]The Mid-Island section was largely undeveloped until 1964, the opening of the Verrazano Bridge. The resulting economic boom means that most of the Mid-Island's architecture is from the late 1960s and 1970s. Some of its main neighborhoods are:\n\n**Old Town**– True to its name, Old Town was the first European settlement on Staten Island. The Dutch called it*Oude Dorpe*.**Todt Hill**– The peak that shares the same name as the neighborhood is considered the highest point on the Eastern Seaboard. Todt Hill has many rich residents, who love to overdecorate their lawns, much to the amusement of other Islanders. These two factors contribute to the area's majestic feel.**Dongan Hills**– This large neighborhood is very peaceful. A section which borders Todt Hill is called the**Dongan Hills Colony**. It is home to large mansions, and offers a unique view of the Manhattan skyline.**South Beach**– Formerly home to a bustling amusement park, South Beach has quieted down a lot from its glory days as a summer getaway. Now, the area is mostly residential, with large Polish and Russian populations. The popular beach of the same name is still open.\n\n**New Dorp**– New Dorp has deep roots in history, spanning back to the American Revolution, when it was the base of the British army in New York. Now, the neighborhood is one of the area's major commercial centers. Its main thoroughfare,**New Dorp Lane**, is home to any type of store you could wish for–from a convenience store, to a fancy cake shop, to mom-and-pop shops, pizzerias, and a karate school.**Richmondtown**– Richmondtown is home to Historic Richmond Town, a collection of buildings dating back as far as the 18th century.**New Dorp Beach/Oakwood Beach**– These two waterfront neighborhoods were hit hard by Hurricane Sandy.**Heartland Village**– The commercial center of the entire island is home to the Staten Island Mall and a number of other large and small shopping centers.**Chelsea and Travis**– Two tiny, mostly industrial neighborhoods on the western edge of the island.\n\n### South Shore\n\n[edit]The South Shore experienced a similar economic boom to the Mid-Island when the Verrazano Bridge opened. However, there are still many parts of the South Shore that are undeveloped, at least compared to the rest of the borough. Some of its neighborhoods are:\n\n**Great Kills**– The northernmost neighborhood on the South Shore is very residential and has a large park and marina.**Eltingville**– This humongous neighborhood is also primarily residential, but is home to a major transit center.**Huguenot**– Huguenot is named after the French Huguenots, its first European settlers. Nowadays, the very suburban neighborhood is home to many other ethnicities as well.**Rossville**– Formerly farmland, Rossville has developed greatly.**Sandy Ground**– Sandy Ground (no connection to Hurricane Sandy) has great historical importance. It was the first community for freed slaves established in North America. It dates back to 1827, when slavery was abolished in New York State.**Charleston**– A very remote neighborhood, it is home to a sizable commercial sector.**Tottenville**– Tottenville is the southernmost point in New York. It developed earlier than the rest of the South Shore, thanks to its prominence as a transportation hub before the invention of automobiles. Many examples of nineteenth-century architecture can be found here.\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]Staten Island is a borough of about 500,000 people. While that's not even half of the population of any of the other boroughs, it's still respectable for a U.S. city, comparable to Omaha or Tucson. Staten Island is in New York Harbor, and is the southernmost point in New York State.\n\n### Orientation\n\n[edit]Staten Island is New York City's only borough that lacks a predominant numbered street grid -- you can not depend on the numbers of the streets to tell you where you are.\n\nStaten Island has four main highways: the Staten Island Expressway (I-278), the West Shore Expressway (NY-440), the Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway (also NY-440), and the Korean War Veterans Parkway (unofficially known as the Richmond Parkway). The Staten Island Expressway runs east-west, from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the Goethals Bridge. The West Shore expressway runs south from the Staten Island Expressway in the northwest portion of the island to the Outerbridge Crossing in Tottenville. The Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway runs north from just east of the SIE's junction with the West Shore to the Bayonne Bridge. The Korean War Veterans Expressway branches off from the West Shore Expressway just north of the Outerbridge and runs northeast all the way to Eltingville.\n\nCompared to the neatly-organized grid of Manhattan, the layout of Staten Island's streets may seem like a child's drawings. On the contrary, most streets run in a simple pattern. The biggest streets run east-west (parallel to the northern shore), north-south (parallel to the western shore), and northeast-southwest (parallel to the eastern and southern shores). This creates the effect of a triangle. If you know the main roads that form each side of the triangle, you won't get lost.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]### By ferry\n\n[edit]Staten Island can be reached by passenger ferry from Manhattan. The ferry is the most visually pleasing option for arriving on the island, as it passes by Liberty Island and offers stunning views of the Manhattan skyline and New York Harbor. The ferry is free and operates 24 hours a day out of Battery Park in Manhattan and St. George Terminal in Staten Island; even during the early morning hours, it never runs less than once every half hour at the half hour. You can see a current schedule on this page. The 25-minute ferry ride is also sometimes a faster trip from Lower Manhattan to Staten Island than a corresponding trip by car or bus. The ferry allows bicycles on the lower decks, where there are usually bike racks.\n\nThe St. George Ferry Terminal is also a terminal for the Staten Island Railway and many of Staten Island's local buses.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]Staten Island can be reached by bridge from Brooklyn and New Jersey.\n\n**Verrazano-Narrows Bridge**connects Brooklyn with Staten Island, but you will incur a high toll of $11.52 with a New York E-Z Pass or $17.00 for out-of-state E-Z Pass users and non-E-Z Pass users (westbound to Staten Island only; no toll eastbound).**Bayonne Bridge**connects Bayonne, New Jersey with northern Staten Island.**Goethals Bridge**connects Elizabeth, New Jersey to mid-western Staten Island.**Outerbridge Crossing**connects Perth Amboy, New Jersey and Tottenville, Staten Island.\n\nThese last 3 bridges have a $15.00 ($10.50 on Off-Peak times and $12.50 on Peak-times for E-ZPass issued by New York or New Jersey) toll payable only when entering Staten Island, not leaving it. The carpool toll is $6.25 with 3 or more people in a car, payable only with E-Z Pass. The Bayonne Bridge and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge use an All-Electronic Tolling System, meaning that no cash payments are allowed, and without E-Z Pass, your toll will be paid via Tolls-By-Mail.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]**Express bus**\n\nA moderately priced option is to take an express bus from Manhattan to Staten Island. The express buses are especially handy when you are traveling to places on the South Shore, which is the furthest section of Staten Island from the ferry, and has fewer local routes running than the more densely populated North Shore. The $7.00 fare is payable with MetroCard (pay-per-ride only), OMNY, Express Bus Plus MetroCards or coin change. Dollar bills are not accepted.\n\nMost express buses run solely on weekdays and go by the acronym SIM (for Staten Island to Manhattan). For lower Manhattan, the SIM2 is popular, whereas SIM10 serves midtown.\n\nThe wait times for an express bus are about 4–10 minutes during rush hours, 15–30 minutes other times. The Staten Island bus map (service descriptions) covers the routes on the island.\n\n**Local bus**\n\n- There is also the option of taking the S53, S79, or S93 buses from the 86th Street subway station of the R train in Brooklyn. These bus routes cross the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge into Staten Island. Since these are considered local bus routes, you can pay for the ride by depositing $2.90 in coins in the farebox or swiping your MetroCard.\n\n- The S53 serves the North Shore and goes through Port Richmond and West New Brighton\n- The S79 serves the Mid-Island region and the South Shore. It goes along Hylan Boulevard and Richmond Avenue to get to the Staten Island Mall.\n- The S93 runs rush hours only and goes to the College of Staten Island, serving the neighborhoods near the Staten Island Expressway and Victory Boulevard.\n\n\n- From Bayonne, you can take the S89 Limited bus during rush hours from the 34th Street Hudson-Bergen Light Rail station. This bus runs down Richmond Avenue and serves sections of the North Shore, Mid-Island, and South Shore.\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]### By rail\n\n[edit]The subway doesn't go to Staten Island. The **Staten Island Railway** is a hybrid of a railroad and a subway line. Fares are the same as a subway ride ($2.90), and it runs 24 hours, at intervals from 15 minutes during weekdays to hourly overnight, synchronized to the ferry schedule. Fares are collected only at St. George Ferry Terminal and Tompkinsville, and include a free transfer to or from the buses or subway in Manhattan. During rush hours, express service is provided and the locals terminate at Great Kills.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]Bus routes cover the island pretty thoroughly. There are two types of buses:\n\n- The\n**local buses**run routes all over Staten Island and are distinguished by the S before the route number (ex. S55, S78). They have uncomfortable plastic seats and cost $2.50. During rush hours, some buses run Limited and stop at major cross streets and transfer points. For example, the S62 starts at Jewett Avenue, making all stops east, while the S92 makes all stops west of Jewett Avenue that the S62 normally makes, while stopping only at major streets like Clove Road east of Jewett Avenue. Limited route numbers are always in the 80s and 90s, and the numbers of the local and limited routes usually correspond (S62/S92, S46/S96).\n\n- Many local buses terminate at the St. George Ferry Terminal. These can be grouped according to their service area:\n- North Shore: S40 series (S40, S42, S44, S46, S48)\n- East Shore: S50s series (S51, S52)\n- Victory Boulevard: S60s series (S61, S62, S66)\n- South Shore: S70s series (S74, S76, S78)\n- Limited routes: S80s and S90s series (S81, S84, S86, S90, S91, S92, S94, S96, S98)\n\n\n\n- However, other routes on Staten Island that do not depart from the Staten Island Ferry Terminal do not necessarily follow the same rule. These are the S53, S54, S55, S56, S57, S59, S79, S89, and S93.\n\n- The\n**express buses**are distinguished by the X in the coded display on the front of the bus (ex. X1, X17). These buses run from Staten Island to Manhattan, have more comfortable cloth seats, and cost $6.\n\nMost bus routes on the island meet up at the **St. George Ferry Terminal**. Other major transfer points include **Port Richmond**, with some buses terminating at Richmond Terrace at Port Richmond Avenue; the **Staten Island Mall**; and the **Eltingville Transit Center** on the South Shore.\n\nFares can be paid in quarters or dollar coins (if you can find them). You can also use a MetroCard (good for all public transportation in NYC), available at some delis or at the machines at the ferry terminal. Buses run close to schedule, but service on Staten Island is sparse outside of rush hours, and even during peak hours, the most frequent headway is 10 minutes. Because of this, it helps to be prepared: either pick up a schedule for routes that you'll plan to take, check the Guide-A-Ride boxes at bus stops for exact times or use the MTA's BusTime system to track buses.\n\nA Staten Island bus map is available on this page.\n\nA word of caution: Staten Island buses are usually reasonably reliable on weekdays, but do not count on the schedule or MTA route advice timings to be accurate on Sundays, and consider making alternate arrangements if your schedule is not completely open for the day.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]### Parks\n\n[edit]As the official \"Borough of Parks\", Staten Island has a large collection of parks. They range from modest playgrounds to immense expanses of raw nature.\n\nAll parks operated by the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation are open 6AM–1AM, but the Greenbelt is operated by the Greenbelt Conservancy and Gateway is operated by the National Park Service. Parks affiliated with schools are the only exception. These are open from dawn to dusk, and it is generally considered good etiquette to stay out of the park if schoolchildren are playing in it.\n\nSome parks in Staten Island are:\n\n- 1 Amundsen Circle, Amboy Road & Riedel Avenue (S57 to Amboy Road & Guyon Avenue, then walk two blocks south down Amboy Road). A small park that is not much more than a clearing and some trees. A monument to the man the park was named for, Roald Amundsen, stands in the center of it.\n- 2 Blue Heron Park, Poillon Avenue & Amboy Road (No public transportation. Entrance for cars is on Poillon Avenue.). A large park on the South Shore known from its large collection of wildlife, from birds to wildflowers. True to its name, the park is a known habitat for blue herons.\n- 3 Clawson Playground, Adelaide Avenue & Emilra Street (S57 to Guyon Avenue & Whitehall Street, then walk east down Guyon Avenue and make a right onto Elmira Street). Open between dawn and dusk, except for school hours. This deceivingly small park has two large asphalt playgrounds, two smaller ones, a grass field, a baseball field, basketball courts, and a jungle gym. It is always peaceful and rarely crowded, as it is shared by Public School 50 during school hours.\n- 4 Freshkills Park, Wild Avenue & Pearson Street (S62/92 to Victory Boulevard & Wild Avenue, then walk 1 block east down Wild Avenue). Only in the first stages of development, this mega-park is set to be 2,200 acres—three times the size of Central Park. It will cover the wild areas of the Fresh Kills, and the former Fresh Kills Dump. The first section of the park,\n**Schmul Park**, in Travis, features a large and colorful playground for kids, along with basketball courts, handball courts, and an open grass field. - A portion of the Gateway National Recreation Area, called the\n**Staten Island Unit**, is located here. It consists of three parks:- 5 Fort Wadsworth (S51/81 to any one of the seven stops inside the park.). 6AM-8PM. Dating back to 1663, this fort was used during both the American Revolution and the War of 1812. It remained active until 1995. It is now semi-active, with its main use being local headquarters for the United States Coast Guard. Tours are available.\n- 6 Miller Field (S76/86 to New Dorp Lane & Cedar Grove Avenue). 6AM-8PM. This park was operated as a United States Army airfield from 1919-1969. Now, it is a large, mostly grass park with baseball fields, soccer fields, and a children's playground.\n- 7 Great Kills Park (S78 or S79 to Great Kills Park). 6AM-8PM. This park is home to a large woodland and a number of beaches. A small portion of the beach is closed for radiation screenings.\n\n- 8 The Greenbelt, 700 Rockland Ave (S54 or S57 to Rockland Avenue & Brielle Avenue), ☏ +1 718 351-3450, naturecenter@sigreenbelt.org. Open dawn to dusk. A humongous collection of woodlands and parks (2,800 acres!), the Greenbelt is a collection of nature you wouldn't expect to see in any major city, let alone New York. The Greenbelt covers much of the Mid-Island, so it's best to know which part you want to go to beforehand. A good place to start is the\n**Greenbelt Nature Center**an educational facility in the center of the park. The park is a great place for hikers, and a map of hiking trails can be found here\n\n- 9 Lemon Creek Park, Hylan Boulevard & Sharrott Avenue (S59 or S78 to Hylan Boulevard and Sharrott Avenue), ☏ +1 718 667-6042.

The park has one of the very few colonies in the New York Metro.\n- 10 Mount Loretto Unique Area. Nature preserve on the South Shore with hiking trails and shoreline access. Fishing is permitted along the beach or the freshwater pond inside the area. Most of the land is minimally developed, and is an excellent place to observe wildlife. An abandoned orphanage on-site, after which the area was named, burnt down in 2000.\n- 11 South Beach & Boardwalk (S51/81 to any stop along Father Cappodano Blvd.). This beach is a pleasant place to relax. The water is safe enough to swim in, but it's not the best you can get (you'd get a better deal down the Jersey Shore or on Long Island). The boardwalk, one of the longest in the United States, is great for running or biking.\n\n- 12 Von Briesen Park. The former estate of Arthur Von Briesen is now a small, hilly park.\n- 13 Willowbrook Park, Eton Place at Richmond Avenue or Victory Boulevard at Morani Street (S62/S92 to Morani Street, S44/S94 to Eton Place).

This is the largest collection of Greek revival, temple style buildings in America. A true architectural gem featuring the Staten Island Botanic Garden, which features an authentic Chinese Scholar's garden (created by actual Chinese scholars!). There is also an art museum, the John A. Noble Collection, on the grounds. This is one of the most beautiful places in New York, a place even the most jaded New Yorker will marvel at.\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]- Staten Island FerryHawks, at the\n**Richmond County Bank Ballpark**at 75 Richmond Terrace (within walking distance of the St. George Ferry Terminal), tickets@ferryhawks.com.

Another large movie theater, the Atrium is also great for taking in a movie.\n\n## Buy\n\n[edit]The shopping in Staten Island is weirdly unique, combining aspects of suburban shopping with things only found in New York City. A number of shopping malls are on Staten Island, including:\n\n- 1 Staten Island Mall, 2655 Richmond Ave (S44/94, S59, S61/91, or S79 to stops labeled Staten Island Mall), ☏ +1 718 761-6800. M-Sa 10AM–9PM, Su 11AM–6PM. The Staten Island Mall is the largest mall in New York City and the center of retail life in Staten Island, anchored by Macy's and JCPenney. There is also a large food court and a variety of smaller stores. In the vicinity, there are a number of sizable shopping centers.\n- 2 Bricktown Centre At Charleston, 2700–2900 Veterans Road West (S74/84 or S78 to Bricktown Mall terminus; From Korean War Veterans Parkway follow \"Charleston Shopping Center\" signs). Taking up 400,000 square feet, this mall houses a small number of large stores.\n- 3 Hylan Plaza, 2630-2670 Hylan Blvd (S78 or S79 to Hylan Boulevard & Beach Avenue). A smaller shopping center, Hylan Plaza is still home to a number of retail stores alongside numerous mom-and-pop shops. It's located along a line of smaller shopping centers.\n- 4 Empire Outlets, 55 Richmond Terrace (5 minute walk from ferry terminal), info@empireoutlets.nyc. Daily, 10AM-9PM. Only outlet mall in New York City\n\nA shopping area clearly influenced by Staten Island's location in New York City is **New Dorp Lane**, located in, you guessed it, New Dorp. New Dorp Lane has the feel of a commercial street in Brooklyn or parts of Manhattan; however, it is far less busy than either of the two. You can walk down one of the wide sidewalks and pass a variety of small businesses. The New Dorp Lane commercial district is best experienced by walking, as New Dorp Lane is notorious for frustratingly bad traffic.\n\nA type of business that is becoming increasingly common on Staten Island is the farmers' market. A number of markets can be found on Staten Island, including the following:\n\n- 5 Saint George Greenmarket, Hyatt Street and St. Marks Place (S42/52 to St. Marks Place & Hyatt Street). May–Dec Sa 8AM–2PM, Jan–Apr Sa 8AM–1PM.\n- 6 Staten Island Mall Greenmarket, Staten Island Mall, Marsh Avenue & Ring Road (commuter lot behind Macy's) (S44/94, S59, S61/91, or S79 to stops labeled Staten Island Mall).

This market sells products only grown on-site.\n\n## Eat\n\n[edit]While the vast majority of Staten Island eateries are Italian, there are some gems of other types of ethnic cuisine in the St. George and Tompkinsville neighborhoods. Mostly within a mile of each other on Victory Blvd (and in walking distance from the ferry terminal), the authentic and inexpensive restaurants serve up flavorful South Asian cuisine well worth the trip.\n\n### Italian\n\n[edit]- 1 Denino's Pizzeria & Tavern, 524 Port Richmond Ave, ☏ +1-718-442-9401. Su–Th 11AM–11PM, F Sa 11AM–midnight.

Noon–9PM daily. A restaurant with authentic Spanish food.\n\n### Sri Lankan\n\n[edit]- 9 Lakruwana, 226 Bay St, ☏ +1-347-857-6619, Newlakruwanasrilankanfood@gmail.com. Tu–Su noon–10PM, closed M. One of the more elegant eateries. Its fine decor and delicious meals belie the outrageously inexpensive prices.

There are several Sri Lankan groceries that dot the street about a 15-20 minute walk from the ferry.\n\n## Drink\n\n[edit]**St. George** has a few bars located south of the ferry terminal. Make a left when you leave the boat. Look for a cozy bar at Beso at 70 Bay Street where you can try a jalapeño margarita.\n\n- 1 Flagship Brewery, 40 Minthorne St, ☏ +1-718-448-5284.

A 16-ounce can of Bud or Miller will cost $3.50.\n\n## Sleep\n\n[edit]Staten Island is the closest borough to New Jersey's Newark International Airport. This results in lower taxi fares and shorter travel times as opposed to Manhattan (the taxi fare is $45 to any point in Staten Island plus up to $10 in tolls). You may want to consider sleeping in a hotel here for this reason.\n\n- 1 Hilton Garden Inn New York/Staten Island, 1100 South Ave ( S46 or S96 to South Ave & Lois Ln), ☏ +1-718-477-2400. Check-in: 3PM, check-out: noon. $140-210.\n\n## Stay safe\n\n[edit]When discussing crime in Staten Island, it first must be established that **Staten Island is not a crime-ridden mob haven**, as it is portrayed in movies and reality TV. Staten Island is no more dangerous than any of the other boroughs of New York City. However, it does have some crime.\n\nThe northern and southern portions of Staten Island are pretty different in the amount of crime and the type of crime found there.\n\nThe North Shore has a somewhat elevated crime rate compared to the rest of the Island. It is home to large low-income housing projects. This attracts a lot of both petty crime and more serious crimes. Be careful when walking alone at night.\n\nOnce you get below the Staten Island Expressway, however, the situation changes. The South Shore has a relatively low crime rate. Residents often joke about it, saying that the local burglars are nice enough to wait until your car is unlocked to rob it.\n\nTravelers to the South Shore with seasonal allergies may be better-advised to worry about high pollen counts during the spring. There are dozens of trees on most South Shore streets (so many you may not believe you're still in New York City). If you have severe allergies, consider addressing the problem before coming to Staten Island in April or May.\n\nIn addition to pollen, trees also bring pesky critters. Please take necessary precautions if you have severe allergies or a strong aversion to any of the following:\n\n- Squirrels\n- Birds and (perhaps more importantly) their droppings\n- Ants\n- Bumblebees\n- Woodpeckers, owls, or other common large birds\n\n## Connect\n\n[edit]The **New York Public Library** offers free wi-fi. In addition, it offers many free programs to help people learn English. This makes it the best place to go if you need a refresher or need to contact someone who speaks a language other than English. These are the Staten Island locations:\n\n- St. George Branch, 5 Central Ave (S42 or S52 to Central Avenue and Hyatt Street.), ☏ +1 718 442-8560.

While the island is a hidden gem, many of the main tourist attractions are around it, and you will want to check them out.\n\nThe first order of business is to make sure you've gone completely through New York City. Each of the four other boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx) have their own attractions and features you'll want to see.\n\nIf you're done in New York, Staten Island is a great launching pad for a trip in New Jersey. Some places to go are:\n\n**Nearby towns**– If you just want to relax after the hustle and bustle of New York City, you can visit**Bayonne**to the north,**Elizabeth**to the northwest,**Linden**to the west, or**Perth Amboy**to the southwest.**Jackson**– Further south than Perth Amboy, Jackson is home to one main attraction:**Six Flags Great Adventure**. This amusement park is the biggest theme park in the Northeastern United States. It is also home to a safari park and a water park (Hurricane Harbor). Its biggest attraction, however, is Kingda Ka, which is the world's tallest roller coaster at 456 feet above the earth.**Sandy Hook**– This narrow strip of land of the coast of New Jersey is home to the Sandy Hook Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area.**The Jersey Shore**– The ultimate destination for summer fun in the Mid-Atlantic is right near New York City.**Atlantic City**– The gambling capital of the Eastern U.S. is also home to a popular beach & boardwalk.**Philadelphia, Pennsylvania**– If need be, you can always skip New Jersey and go straight on to the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nRoutes through Staten Island |\n\nLinden ← Elizabeth ← |\nW E |\n→ Brooklyn → Queens |\nEdison ← Perth Amboy ← becomes ← |\nS N |\n→ becomes → Bayonne → Jersey City |"}
{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Jersey_City", "title": "Jersey_City", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Jersey_City", "text": "**Jersey City** is New Jersey's second-largest city. Jersey City sits in Hudson County in the northeastern section of the state, across the Hudson from its older and bigger cousin, New York City and south of Hoboken. It is frequently referred to as New York’s “sixth borough”.\n\nUntil the early 1600s, the area was inhabited by Lenape Indians. The Dutch then settled here as a part of the colony of New Amsterdam, it evolved into an industrial powerhouse, with railroads winding up and down the city (some of these lines are still used today). Although Jersey City lost its powerhouse status and became troubled with decline in the 1960s, the decline would begin to be reversed in the 1980s, and the city would be transformed into what it is today. Most tourists may only come in for cheap accommodation and its proximity to New York City, but Jersey City has plenty of things to offer up for the average visitor, including miles of recreational space with panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline, diverse neighborhoods, and dining options that rival those found across the river.\n\n## Districts\n\n[edit]**Historic Downtown**- This area, directly to the west of the waterfront, is characterized by rows of restored brownstones, new condominiums, and some retail (largely centered on Grove Street). This area includes the historic neighborhoods of**Paulus Hook**along the Morris Canal, and**Hamilton Park**,**Harsimus Cove**, and**Van Vorst Park**further inland.**Waterfront**- Although considered to be part of Downtown Jersey City by most locals, this area is often categorized as a separate neighborhood because it is so different from the Historic Downtown area. Characterized by high-rise condos and office towers, it's also home to the planned community of**Newport**, which includes the popular Newport Mall.**Journal Square**- Named after the*Jersey Journal*, whose headquarters are here, this is the commercial heart of the city. It's home to the Hudson County Community College, and to the county's courthouse and administration buildings.**The Heights**- Situated atop the Palisades, this primarily residential neighborhood is home to some of the county's best preserved Victorian mansions. This area has unparalleled views of the Manhattan skyline, owing to its location high above downtown Jersey City and Hoboken.**Liberty State Park**- This district includes Liberty State Park itself, Cochrane Stadium/Caven Point Athletic Complex, and the exclusive Port Liberte development, which is home to luxury townhouses and condominiums as well as the Liberty National Golf Course.**Bergen/Lafayette**- This neighborhood of brownstones, row houses, and pre-war buildings is slowly feeling the effects of gentrification from the neighboring downtown area and the restoration of the massive Art Deco former medical center to residences and commercial space.**West Side**- This ethnically diverse neighborhood is home to Lincoln Park, Jersey City's own Central Park, New Jersey City University, and residential developments at the Hackensack River at Droyer's Point.**Greenville**- This area in the southern end of Jersey City is considered the roughest part of the city, but it is slowly being redeveloped.\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]Jersey City is the second-largest city in New Jersey, trailing Newark in population, but far surpassing Trenton, the state capital. It is on a peninsula that includes Hoboken to the north and Bayonne to the south, and is bounded by the Hudson River and Manhattan to the east and the Hackensack River to the west. An interesting geographic feature of the city is that within its borders are the only two cases in the country where a US state has exclaves that are both geographically and politically surrounded by another state: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, both exclaves of New York in New Jersey. As a result of a 1997 federal court decision, most of Ellis Island is now within Jersey City, with New York retaining a small landlocked portion that encompasses most of the immigration building.\n\nJersey City shares much of its history, geography, and culture with New York City, much moreso than other parts of New Jersey. Like New York City, it was settled by the Dutch in the 1600s, and this is still evidenced today by the prevalence of Dutch place names in both cities, and the use of the Dutch tricolors in their very similar flags. As in Brooklyn, rows of brownstones and other rowhouses started being built throughout Jersey City with the arrival of the steam ferry in the 1820s and continued throughout the 19th century. Ellis Island was a large source of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe and Ireland that shaped the culture of both Jersey City and New York City from the 1880s until the 1920s.\n\nThe opening of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad tunnels into Manhattan in 1908 caused another population boom, with tenements and grand apartment buildings going up in neighborhoods such as Journal Square and along Kennedy Boulevard in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nOnce a humming center of industry, Jersey City housed the booming factories of Colgate and Dixon-Ticonderoga. It was a railroad hub, where the transcontinental rail lines of the country's great railroads (including the famed Pennsylvania Railroad) converged from all across the country. All the railroads to New York City actually ended on the Jersey side of the waterfront, where passengers transferred to ferries to go into Manhattan. Today, Jersey City is neither of these things. Decades of deindustrialization, railroad bankruptcies, government mismanagement and other disappointments had a profound effect on this once booming town. The automobile era and a fear of urban areas caused significant \"white flight\" to the suburbs in the middle of the 20th century; once affluent areas became centers of poverty and crime. The city lost 87,000 people, almost a third of its population, and apartment buildings and row houses became vacant lots and parking lots. Jersey City was a mirror of what was happening in New York City, although perhaps to a more significant and depressing degree.\n\nDuring the 1970s, immigrants began moving to Jersey City in droves, attracted by cheap real estate and a chance at experiencing the storied American dream. Today, these immigrants have helped to shape the city into a melting pot of the world's cultures and ethnicities. Nowhere else in the state is there a city as diverse and as interesting as Jersey City in this respect.\n\nLater, the growing popularity of New York City in the 1990s had a significant impact on Jersey City, too. Old railyards along the waterfront became the sites of gleaming new office towers and high-rise condominiums. Brownstones further inland were fixed up by people moving back into the city. Jersey City's renaissance quickly began.\n\nThe city has gone through significant transformations over the course of its lifetime. And it's not over yet. High-rises continue to sprout up along the waterfront like weeds, attracting Manhattanites priced out of the real estate market there, while offering quick commutes to jobs in Downtown Manhattan and Midtown. Office towers continue to fill up with new tenants, including the backoffice functions of many New York City-based companies, earning it the moniker \"Wall Street West.\" (In fact, Jersey City has more Class A office space than downtown Pittsburgh or Atlanta.) New stores catering to Jersey City's new gentry continue to pop up almost weekly. It's a city in transition, and it's exciting and frightening at the same time.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]### By plane\n\n[edit]Jersey City is about a 10-minute ride from **Newark Liberty International Airport** (**EWR** IATA), which is a major hub for United Airlines, and is one of the three airports serving the New York metropolitan area. A taxi to Jersey City from EWR will set you back about $40.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of bags, consider taking the train from the airport. Catch AirTrain from your terminal to the Newark Airport train station. Take a New York-bound New Jersey Transit train one stop to Newark Penn Station, then cross the platform to catch the PATH to Jersey City. On weekdays, you can take the North Jersey Coast Line to Hoboken where you can transfer to the PATH train. The AirTrain/NJ Transit train is $8.25; PATH is $2.75. The ride takes about 45 minutes.\n\nThe two other airports in the region are **LaGuardia Airport** (**LGA** IATA) and **John F. Kennedy International Airport** (**JFK** IATA), both in the borough of Queens in New York City. A cab from LGA or JFK to Jersey City will cost about $100. From JFK airport it is also possible to take either the A or E subway trains from Howard Beach or Jamaica respectively and transfer at World Trade Center to the PATH.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]Driving into Jersey City is not recommended. While driving into Jersey City is only difficult at rush hour, finding on-street parking once you are there is a hassle at all times of day. Many streets -- particularly in downtown Jersey City and Journal Square -- require parking permits to park for longer than a couple of hours. If you park in a permit zone, your car may be booted by the Parking Authority, especially if you have out-of-state plates.\n\nSince Jersey City sits at the western end of the Holland Tunnel, your best bet is to take any highway that leads directly to it. On the New Jersey side, this includes Interstate 78 (look for signs to exits 14-14c), US 1-9, and Interstate 280. On the New York side, take the West Side Highway and Canal Street from Manhattan.\n\n### By train\n\n[edit]The **PATH** metro service runs has multiple stops in Jersey City with connections to Newark, Lower Manhattan, Midtown Manhattan, and Hoboken. It costs $2.75 one-way.\n\nPATH payment options:\n\n- You can use contactless payment options (eg a credit/debit card or a smartphone wallet) to pass through dedicated gates via the Total Access PATH Payment (TAPP) pilot. TAPP-enabled gates are available at every PATH station.\n- An RFID-type stored value card called\n*Smartlink*affords PATH users discounts: $26 for 10 trips; $52 for 20 trips; $104 for 40 trips. However, the card itself must be purchased ($5, $57 including 20 trips). - Single-ride and pay-per-ride MetroCards, compatible with the New York City subway system, can be used on the PATH. You can purchase a single-ride MetroCard from the vending machines near the turnstiles; they accept cash or credit/debit cards. Unlimited MetroCards (i.e., the 7-day and 30-day unlimited ride cards for the subway) cannot be used on PATH.\n\nTAPP and Smartlink are separate from the New York City OMNY payment system. PATH does not accept OMNY RFID cards, and PATH trips do not contribute to the OMNY weekly fare cap.\n\nThe **Hudson-Bergen Light Rail**, operated by NJ Transit, connects the Jersey City waterfront to Hoboken, Weehawken, Union City, North Bergen and Bayonne.\n\nFrom the Pavonia/Newport PATH station, Lower Manhattan is about seven minutes away, Midtown Manhattan (33rd Street) is about 15 minutes away, and Newark Penn Station is about 25 minutes away. From Newark Penn Station, you can connect to regional New Jersey Transit and interstate Amtrak trains.\n\nThe nearest locations that **New Jersey Transit** trains stop are in Newark-Penn Station and Hoboken -- you will have to switch to either PATH or the Light Rail to get to Jersey City from there.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]NJ Transit and other operators run buses to the Journal Square Transportation Center bus terminal. Greyhound buses stop at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and the bus terminal at Newark Penn Station. From the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York, take NJ Transit Buses 125 and 119 which go directly to Journal Square (the fare is $3.10; trip takes about 30 minutes) or NJ Transit Bus 1 from Newark Penn Station.\n\n### By boat\n\n[edit]NY Waterway operates four ferry routes connecting Jersey City to Manhattan. The routes from Port Liberté and Liberty Harbor connect to Pier 11 in Lower Manhattan. The other two ferry routes leave from Exchange Place, and connect to World Financial Center and West 39th Street in Midtown. Check the NY Waterway website for schedules.\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]|\nDollar vans\nIntrepid wanderers might find the \"dollar\" vans a quick and cheap way to travel around town. These vans, which are operated largely by Hispanic immigrants to serve that community, arose in response to the lack of frequent and reliable bus service in the area. Although no longer a dollar (the fare is now $1.75), these small buses travel from Newport Mall up Newark Avenue, brush past Journal Square, and travel up Palisade Avenue towards the Heights (similar vans run up Kennedy Boulevard from Journal Square). Also, they run to-and-fro between NYC and Journal Square, the fare being $2.50, which is much cheaper. These vans don't travel on a fixed schedule, but operate relatively frequently during the day (they come by every five minutes or so). To get on board, flag the driver down. To get off the bus, say \"next stop\" to the driver about a block or so before your desired stop. Pay the driver as you leave the bus. |\n\nThe best way to navigate within Jersey City, as a tourist, is on foot and via mass transit. As a dense urban environment Jersey City, and especially its tourist and commercial destinations, are well served by PATH, light rail, and bus service.\n\n### By taxi\n\n[edit]Unlike in Manhattan, taxis can be difficult to come by in Jersey City. You often have to call ahead to have one pick you up, although taxis are stationed at the Exchange Place, Grove Street and Journal Square PATH stations. Taxis in Jersey City can run either metered or unmetered (flat rate); the price is generally the same either way. If you are going unmetered, ask the price before getting into the taxi (or ask the dispatcher when you call ahead). Taxis are not cheap; a cab from Grove Street to Journal Square is about $10.\n\nApp based ride share services like Lyft and Uber operate in Jersey City. Via has also partnered with the city to operate an on demand ride share system that only runs within Jersey City. The Via fleet of minivans and SUVs holds multiple passengers and offers wheelchair accessible rides. Via is a discount option with rates starting at $2 per ride but wait times at its 'virtual bus stops' are typically 15-20mins.\n\n### By transit\n\n[edit]PATH service, in addition to offering outside connections, has four stops in Jersey City: Journal Square, Grove Street, Exchange Place, and Pavonia/Newport. Connections to the light rail can be made at the Exchange Place and Pavonia stops. The Journal Square stop offers connections to the Journal Square Transportation Center and a variety of NJ Transit bus routes.\n\nBus service covers all corners of Jersey City but service levels vary by route.\n\nThe Hudson-Bergen Light Rail runs largely north/south through the city. It connects the downtown Jersey City waterfront to Hoboken in the north and to Bergen Lafayette, Greenville, and Bayonne to the south. Note the light rail operates on a proof-of-payment ticketing system which means digital and paper tickets must be activated prior to boarding. Paper tickets must be time stamped using validator machines located at light rail stations. Digital tickets must be activated prior to boarding and will take three minutes before they become valid.\n\nBoth the light rail and bus systems are operated by NJ Transit. Download the official NJ Transit app for route information and schedules. The in app ticketing system is especially beneficial for visitors allowing you to navigate the sometimes complex zone and fare system prior to boarding which will save you the time and hassle of trying to figure it out while boarding the bus.\n\n### By bike\n\n[edit]*Citibike* provided by Lyft is the exclusive bike share system in Jersey City and has many docks around Downtown Jersey City. The docks are more spaced out the farther you go out of downtown (map). The Citibike system in Jersey City is integrated with neighboring New York City and Hoboken. Accounts, passes, and keys work across all three municipalities. Daily rates range from $3.99 for a single ride to a $15 day pass.\n\nDue to a recent investment by the local government many streets have protected bike lanes. Off road shared use trails can be found along the Hudson River waterfront and in Liberty State Park. The East Coast Greenway, a bike path that runs from Maine to Florida, cuts through Jersey City from Newark, eastward through Lincoln Park and city streets, to the ferries and to the riverfront walkway running north. As of 2022, bike routes across the Hackensack river are limited to the Lincoln Highway Hackensack River Bridge but should be expanded with the completion of the Wittpenn Bridge and the Essex-Hudson Greenway.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]- 1 Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse, Washington Boulevard. The Powerhouse is a Romanesque revival industrial masterpiece built between 1906 and 1908. The Powerhouse was designed by architect John Oakman, an alumnus of the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. The Powerhouse allowed the operation of the first trans-Hudson subway, the direct predecessor of today's PATH. It ceased operation as a power generating station in 1929. After years of neglect, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 after it was nominated by the Jersey City Landmarks Conservancy, an all volunteer not-for-profit organization. The city has designated the Powerhouse a developer, the Cordish company, which has renovated a similar power plant in Baltimore's Harbor.\n- 2 Jersey City City Hall, 280 Grove St. (ride the PATH to Grove Street station, then walk south on the street of the same name). Completed in 1896, this imposing granite and marble municipal structure was designed by Lewis Broome, who also designed the Trenton Statehouse. A bronze memorial monument by Philip Martiny stands in the small plaza in front of the City Hall entrance. The memorial bears the inscription: \"Erected by the People of Hudson County to Commemorate the Valor of the Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines of the Civil War.\" The statue is of the Goddess of Victory in a seated pose. Although she has lain aside her shield, her hand rests in readiness upon her sword, though she offers the olive branch of peace.\n- 3 Justice William Brennan Courthouse (Hudson County Courthouse), 583 Newark Ave. (Walk east from Journal Square station.), ☏ +1 201-795-6600. This stunning Beaux-Arts style building is a glimpse into the county's rich and storied history. Be sure to check out its stained glass dome and detailed murals. Guided tours are available on weekdays.\n- 4 Colgate Clock, 2 Hudson Street (Walk from Essex Street or Exchange Place stations.). Dating back to 1924, the Colgate clock is a reminder of the numerous industries which once dominated the city. Manhattan residents still glance across the Hudson to tell the time from this iconic clock.\n- 5 Liberty State Park, Morris Pesin Drive (take the New Jersey Turnpike to exit 14B; once you made it to the exit, make a left after the last toll plaza. Light rail via the Liberty State Park stop.), ☏ +1 201-915-3440, toll-free: +1 201-915-3400. Daily 6AM-10PM. Liberty State Park (map) is as large as New York's Central Park but is far less developed. Nonetheless, it gets some 4 million visitors a year, drawn to the waterfront to see unsurpassed views of Manhattan, Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. Don't miss fireworks displays over the water in the Fourth of July! Most tourists see the Statue of Liberty from Manhattan, but if you're coming by car, it's easier to do so from the Park. Make your reservations online ahead of time. Admission to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are free, but you must buy a ferry ticket to make it to both sites. The ferry is first-come, first-served, but your advance reservation will guarantee you a particular window of time in which to visit the Statue. Tickets are sold in the historic Central Railroad of New Jersey (CRRNJ) terminal. While you are waiting for the ferry to depart, be sure to admire its early 20th-century ironwork and architecture. For immigrants heading west to places like Chicago and Pittsburgh after processing at Ellis Island, this is where their overland rail journeys began. Free.\n- 6 Liberty Science Center, 222 Jersey City Blvd (take the light rail to Liberty State Park station, and follow the signs to the Science Center, or Ttke the NJ Turnpike to exit 14b, or 14c), ☏ +1 201-200-1000.

One of the five Loew's \"Wonder Palaces,\" the Loew's Jersey was one of New York City's flagship movie palaces. The interior of the theater is surprisingly intricate and detailed; one person remarked that standing in the lobby of the Loew's is like standing inside a Faberge egg. It is being lovingly restored by a local group, and often hosts live events and screens movie revivals.\n- 9 Lincoln Park, 690 WestSide Ave (take the 80 bus from Journal Square to Kensington Ave), ☏ +1 201-915-1388. Belmont Avenue at WestSide Avenue. In 1905, “West Side Park”, as it used to be called, was designed by landscape architect Charles Lowrie and Daniel W. Langston and features multiple historical points of interest. “Lincoln the Mystic”, a seated statue of the US President, was sculpted by James Earle Fraser. It was dedicated on June 14, 1930 when the park was given its current name of Lincoln Park. The fountain at the entrance of Lincoln Park was designed by the sculptor Pierre J. Cheronin and completed in 1911. It is 53 ft (16 m) high and decorated with water spouting frogs and allegorical figures and is considered the largest concrete fountain in the world. The park honors history through several monuments, such the Irish Famine Memorial, Civil War Soldier statue, James T. Farrier Firefighter Memorial, and by the display of two historic cannons and sun houses.\n- 10 Apple Tree House, 298 Academy St (walk south from Journal Square PATH), ☏ +1 201-547-6921. House where Generals George Washington and Marquis de Lafayette dined and discussed war tactics.

Build c 1740.\n- 12 Paulus Hook (take the Light Rail to Essex St). Today, Paulus Hook is a charming neighborhood of Brownstone Row Houses with an excellent view of New York city, served by a light rail. It used to be a small peninsula surrounded by marsh, and connected the mainland by a causeway that was passable only at low tide. It was the main landing point before the Revolutionary War for travelers going into Bergen County from New York City. It has since been backfilled and Paulus Hook is no longer a hook. Paulus Hook was the site of British fortifications during the revolution that caused serious problems for the local revolutionary government- it was used as a base for loyalist raids into Bergen County. Major Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee (father of the later Confederate General Robert E. Lee) took the fortifications by a night assault carried out during low tide on August 19, 1779.\n- 13 St Paul's Roman Catholic Church, 14 Greenville Ave, ☏ +1 201-433-8500, toll-free: +1 201-433-9886.

Designed in the 1890s with stained-glass windows, a Seth Thomas clock, a Romanesque-Byzantine edifice, and a recreation of Raphael's \"Disputation of the Holy Sacrament\". The church's design features a gold tessera (a fusion of pure gold leaf and two pieces of glass) which only four other churches in the United States have.\n- 15 Pershing Field, Summit Ave (take the 83 bus from Journal Square and get off at the Carlton Ave stop). The park offers a lot of recreational activities including a running track, a pool, and an ice-skating rink. However, the park has a very deep military history since it was the location of a military camp during World War I. The park offers memorials for those who served in both world wars, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The park even has remnants of an old armory that once was located in McGinley Square.\n- 16 Reservoir No 3, Reservoir Ave at Summit Ave (next to Pershing Field). This was the location of one of the nation's first water works facilities. The reservoir fell into disuse in the 1990s, and it began to look like a smaller version of the New Jersey Meadowlands. Today, the reservoir one of the few places within the New York metro area to view wildlife, but you must make an appointment online.\n- 17 Empty Sky 9/11 Memorial, 1 Audrey Zapp Dr (the memorial is next to the former CRRNJ Terminal which is where they hand out tickets for the Statue of Liberty ferries). Memorial dedicated to all 746 9/11 casualties from New Jersey.

Memorial park under construction commemorating COVID-19 victms of New Jersey. Opens in 2023\n\n- 20 India Square, 800 Newark Ave. Largest enclave of Asian Indians in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]**Walk along the Hudson Waterfront.**Take in the breathtaking views. From most points along the waterfront, you can see (on a clear day) from the Verrazano Narrows Bridge all the way up the Hudson River to Midtown Manhattan. Just south of the Exchange Place PATH station is a waterfront pier which extends some 250 m into the Hudson River. From the pier, one will often see locals fishing, tourists taking pictures of the Manhattan skyline, and even people playing chess at one of the tables on the pier. This is one of the most popular locations to photograph the Island of Manhattan, as it is directly across from downtown and the World Trade Center.- 1 Ferry to the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island, 1 Audrey Zapp Dr, toll-free: +1-877-523-9849. Although most people visiting these sites take the ferries from Battery Park in Lower Manhattan, you can also catch the Statue Cruises ferries bound for Liberty Island and Ellis Island from Liberty State Park. The landing is directly in front of the old Central Railroad of New Jersey terminal building.\n- 2 RPM Raceway, 99 Caven Point Rd (take exit 14b from the NJ Turnpike, make a left at the stop sign, then make a right at the first traffic light), ☏ +1 201-333-7223. Formerly the Pole Position Raceway, RPM is an indoor go-kart race track where you can race others at 45 mph (72 km/h).\n\n## Buy\n\n[edit]Although Jersey City isn't known for its extensive shopping options, the City's new gentry have begun to bring with it classier and pricier shops. Nevertheless, some \"old school\" shops and bodegas (delis) continue to be mainstays, particularly for locals. Parts of Jersey City are in the Urban Enterprise Zone (UEZ) program, which allows retailers to charge half the state's sales tax (3.4375%) rather than the full sales tax rate, and clothing is not taxed at all. Retailers often have stickers on their doors showing that they participate in the UEZ program.\n\n- 1 Heights Shopping District, Central Ave (take the 87 bus from Greenville or the 119 from New York and Bayonne).\n- 2 Tia's Place, 277 Grove Street (next to Razza). Trendy clothing store, for the hipster set, catering mostly to women (although they do have a men's section).\n- 3 Newport Centre Mall, 30 Mall Dr West (from Newark Bay Extension East: make a right on Jersey Ave and follow the signs; the Light Rail and PATH trains also stop to Pavonia/Newport), ☏ +1 201-626-2078.

All of the mall's more than 150 stores are part of the Urban Enterprise Zone. It's not free to park in the mall's parking garages; it's $2 to park there for up to 2 hours. Watch out if you stay parked longer than 6 hours; the rate zooms up, presumably to capture commuters parking there to take the PATH train from the Pavonia/Newport station to Manhattan. HBLR also serves Newport Center.\n- 4 Hudson Mall, 701 NJ-440 (after crossing the two drawbridges from exit 15e, follow the signs to Route 440), ☏ +1 201-432-0119.\n- 5 Journal Square, 930 Bergen Ave (take the PATH train from 33rd St or the World Trade Center (New York) to the end, or the 125 bus from the Port Authority Bus Terminal).\n- 6 Stadium Plaza Shopping Center, Kellogg St (take NJ Turnpike to exit 15E to Jersey City, then follow the signs to Route 440).

From wonderfully affordable Indian and Cuban restaurants to uber-trendy hotspots to elegant dining options offering stunning views of Manhattan with dinner, Jersey City has a little something for everyone. The city is also developing its own street food culture, which is somewhat similar to New York's. Vendors are typically around Exchange Place and near other recreational areas throughout the city.\n\n### Budget\n\n[edit]- 1 Wonder Bagels, 517 Jersey Ave (From Grove St Path, walk on Columbus Dr away from the skyscrapers), ☏ +1 201-433-0575, wonderbagels@yahoo.com. 5AM–3PM.

Dosa Hut (as with many South Indian restaurants) is vegetarian.\n- 5 White Mana, 480 Tonnelle Avenue (take the Lincoln Tunnel Exit from the Pulaski Skyway and make a right on the first traffic light (Manhattan Ave)), ☏ +1 201-963-1441.

M-Sa 5-10PM. This restaurant is only open for 5 hours a day, and reservations and deliveries aren’t a thing here. The crowds, the long wait times, and everything else is all worth it however, as once you are seated you will get to taste some of the best pizza in the NYC area.

Previously owned by Dominic Santana, a local promoter who was known for his attempts to flaunt the city's restrictive cabaret laws and also known for owning the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.

The restaurant is named after \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee, father of Robert E.

Daily 5:30AM-10PM.\n\n## Sleep\n\n[edit]Many budget-minded New York City tourists decide to stay in moderately-priced Jersey City hotels because of its proximity to Manhattan. Hotels along or near the waterfront are quite safe and very well-appointed. Avoid the strip of motels along US 1-9 (Tonnelle Avenue) north of Journal Square. The area is industrial, unsafe, and is a haven for prostitution and other illicit activities.\n\n### Budget\n\n[edit]- 1 Holland Hotel, Holland Tunnel Plaza East, ☏ +1 201-963-6200. This non-descript motel, directly in front of the Holland Tunnel, is a popular option for budget-minded travellers. It's clean, safe, reasonably priced, and only a short walk from the Pavonia/Newport PATH station.\n- 2 Ramada Limited Jersey City, 65 Tonnelle Avenue, ☏ +1 201-432-6100, toll-free: +1 866 523-3959. Check-in: 3PM, check-out: noon. Short walk to Journal Square, offers transportation to Newark Airport.\n\n### Mid-range\n\n[edit]- 3 Sonesta Simply Suites, 21 Second Street, ☏ +1 201-659-2500.\n- 4 Courtyard Jersey City Newport, 540 Washington Boulevard (take New Jersey Turnpike North towards New York City; take Exit 14C towards the Holland Tunnel; after paying the toll at 14C continue toward the Holland Tunnel; turn right on Jersey Avenue (first light); immediately bear left toward the Newport Centre Mall and continue to Washington Boulevard (first stop light) and turn right; hotel is on the left), ☏ +1 201-626-6600, fax: +1 201-626-6601. By the Newport Centre Mall and one block from the waterfront.\n- 5 Canopy by Hilton Jersey City Arts District, 159 Morgan St, ☏ +1 201-241-4664. Check-in: 3PM, check-out: noon. Comfortable rooms with stylishly modern decor. Service is friendly and diligent. Amenities include a large hotel bar/restaurant, a small but complete fitness center, and meeting/ballrooms. The lobby is also large and amply supplied with seating, making it a good meeting point for groups split across multiple rooms. Located practically on top of Grove Street PATH Station, giving easy access to Manhattan, but also within easy walking distance of most attractions and nightlife in Downtown Jersey City (especially the Newark Ave. pedestrian mall).\n\n### Splurge\n\n[edit]- 6 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City, 455 Washington Boulevard (the closest train station is the Harsimus Cove Light Rail Station), ☏ +1 201-499-2400. Check-in: 4PM, check-out: 11AM. Popular with business travelers, this all-suite hotel is near the Pavonia/Newport PATH and Newport Mall.\n- 7 Hyatt Regency Jersey City on the Hudson, 2 Exchange Place (from the Holland Tunnel (exiting NY): make a left on Grove St., at the fourth traffic light (Columbus Ave) make a left; the Hyatt is at the end of the road), ☏ +1 201-469-1234, conciergenewjp@hyatt.com. On the Hudson River, this hotel has fabulous views of Manhattan. And it's practically right beside the Exchange Place PATH station, making trips into Manhattan a breeze. The Hyatt is easily Jersey City's nicest hotel.\n\n## Connect\n\n[edit]Jersey City is served by two area codes - 201 and the overlay area code, 551. This means that 10-digit dialing is required. When dialing locally (within the 201 and 551 area codes), do not dial +1 before the number. For calls to other area codes, you must dial +1 before the number you're calling. Even though New York City is just across the Hudson, it's considered to be a long-distance call. Of course, with the advent of cellphones, long-distance calling is quickly becoming a thing of the past.\n\nAs in Manhattan, internet cafes are fairly uncommon in Jersey City as Wi-Fi is becoming more readily available. Notably, Janam Indian Tea on Grove Street and the Daily Grind Coffee Lounge on Morris Street offer free Wi-Fi connections.\n\n## Stay safe\n\n[edit]Jersey City is very safe for a major city, and its crime rate is comparable to that of New York City. However, it pays to exercise precautions. Outside of Journal Square, Historic Downtown, and the Newark Avenue pedestrian plaza, many streets are virtually deserted after midnight, making those walking alone easy targets. If you must walk alone, stick to well-lit, major streets and don't flash your valuables.\n\nTry to avoid the southern section of the city, bordering Bayonne, particularly the neighborhood of Greenville. In particular, Martin Luther King Drive and Ocean Avenue should be avoided. This is the most crime-ridden portion of the city and it is a primarily low-income area, which is close to Liberty Science Center, Liberty State Park, and other areas that would be of interest to tourists. Making a wrong turn near these destinations can lead visitors traveling by car into unsavory neighborhoods. The light rail stations south of Jersey Avenue are within the southern areas of the city, and exercising caution is heavily suggested after dark.\n\nDo not leave any valuables in your car.\n\n## Go next\n\n[edit]- Manhattan - Some of the world's finest dining, entertainment, shopping, and nightlife are only a ten-minute train ride away. Leave your car at one of the numerous parking lots and garages around Grove Street or Journal Square PATH stations and take in all that America's greatest city has to offer.\n- Newark - Despite its reputation for high crime and race riots, Newark is undergoing a renaissance of its own. Be sure to check out a show at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC), one of the best concert halls in the country. After that, hit up the vibrant Ironbound neighborhood for some amazing Brazilian food.\n- Hoboken - Reputedly, Hoboken has the most bars per square mile of any city in the United States. And it's only a PATH ride away.\n- The Gateway, or North Jersey, is surprisingly diverse.\n- Jersey Shore-a day trip to some of the finest beaches on the East Coast\n\nRoutes through Jersey City |\n\nAllentown ← Newark ← |\nW E |\n→ Manhattan → END |\nNew York City ← Fort Lee ← |\nN S |\n→ Newark → Philadelphia |\nNew York City ← Fort Lee ← |\nN S |\n→ Newark → Cape May |\nEND ← |\nN S |\n→ Bayonne → Edison |\nEND ← Hoboken ← |\nN S |\n→ Bayonne → END |\nNorth Bergen ← Hoboken ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nEND ← Hoboken ← |\nNW SE |\n→ Financial District, Manhattan → END |\nNewark ← Harrison ← |\nW E |\n→ Financial District, Manhattan → END |\nEND ← |\nSW NE |\n→ Greenwich Village, Manhattan → Herald Square, Manhattan |"}
{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Hoboken", "title": "Hoboken", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hoboken", "text": "**Hoboken** (HOH-boh-kən) is a small city on the Hudson River in northeastern New Jersey. Once known only as the birthplace of baseball and crooner Frank Sinatra and the site of Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken has become a party town, rich in bars and clubs, and a bedroom community for young, mostly twenty-something professionals who work across the river in New York City\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]### By plane\n\n[edit]**Newark Liberty International Airport** (**EWR** IATA) is the closest of metro New York three major airports. To get to downtown Hoboken take any New Jersey Transit train headed for New York to Secaucus Junction and change there to a train headed for Hoboken Terminal. During rush hour, some trains run directly to Hoboken from Newark Airport Station.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]**From New Jersey**: Take Route 3 East (Garden State Parkway exit 153, Turnpike exit 16E) to Route 495 East and exit on the \"Last exit in New Jersey\", then turn right at the bottom of the hill. Or take the NJ Turnpike to exits 14-14C and stay on I-78, then make a left at the traffic light. The same traffic light can also be reached from the Pulaski Skyway from Newark. Another option is taking the Paterson Plank Road from Route 3 where you would have to take this road all the way to the end. If you choose to take the Paterson Plank Road, you need to keep in mind that when you're on Route 3, the exit to take will be labeled as 'North Bergen'**From New York**: Tune into 1010 WINS or WCBS 880 both on the AM (radio) dial to see whether the wait to get into New Jersey is shorter at the Lincoln Tunnel or the Holland Tunnel. If you're in Midtown or the wait is much shorter at the Lincoln Tunnel, take that. Keep right, and follow the signs for Hoboken. If you're downtown or the wait is much shorter at the Holland Tunnel, take that. When you get out of the tunnel, make the first right turn. You will soon find yourself in downtown Hoboken.\n\n### By rail\n\n[edit]The terminus station, the **Lackawanna Terminal**, is a major transportation hub for regional and commuter rail, mostly operated by **New Jersey Transit**. Connections with **Amtrak** can be made in Pennsylvania Station in Newark or New York Pennsylvania Station.\n\nTrain lines serving Hoboken:\n\n- Main Line\n- Bergen County Line\n- Pascack Valley Line\n- Morristown Line and Gladstone Branch of the Morris and Essex Lines\n- Montclair-Boonton Line\n- Raritan Valley Line (limited service)\n\n**PATH train**\n\nFrom New Jersey, go to Journal Square, or Grove Street and pick up a 33rd St. New York-bound PATH train and transfer to a Hoboken-bound PATH train at Newport. From Newark's Pennsylvania Station, and Harrison take a World Trade Center bound train to Exchange place and transfer to a Hoboken bound train. Newport and Exchange Place have trains bound for Hoboken.\n\nFrom Manhattan in New York City, pick up a Hoboken-bound PATH train at 33rd & 6th Ave., 23rd & 6th Ave., 14th & 6th Ave., 9th & 6th Ave., Christopher St. & Hudson St., or the World Trade Center station.\n\n**Hudson-Bergen Light Rail**\n\nHoboken Terminal is the terminus for two of the three Hudson-Bergen Light Rail services. The Hoboken Terminal-Tonnelle Avenue service to North Bergen and the 22nd Street-Hoboken Terminal service to Bayonne (including Bayonne Flyer service) both operate from the south end of the terminal concourse. The West Side Avenue-Tonnelle Avenue service bypasses Hoboken Terminal, requiring passengers from stations on the West Side Branch to transfer at stations between Pavonia-Newport and Liberty State Park. Hoboken also offers two more light-rail stops; 2nd Street and 9th Street. These stations are meant for those who want to access the western parts of the city or for those who want an easy way from Union City to Hoboken\n\n### By ferry\n\n[edit]Hoboken has two ferry terminals, **Hoboken Terminal** (see By rail-section) and 1 Hoboken 14th Street. **New York Waterway** runs ferries to and from World Financial Center Pier 11 and Manhattan Midtown.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]From NJ: NJ Transit Buses serve Hoboken Terminal\n\n- 22 to North Bergen via Bergenline Avenue\n- 23 to North Bergen (limited service)\n- 64 to Lakewood (limited service)\n- 68 to Old Bridge (limited service)\n- 85 to Secaucus - Harmon Meadow - Mill Creek\n- 87 to Jersey City (Gates Avenue) via Journal Square\n- 89 to North Bergen via Park Avenue\n- 126 to Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan via Lincoln Tunnel\n\nCoach USA\n\n- 5 to Lincoln Harbor or Jersey City (on Washington Street)\n- 144 to Staten Island (limited service)\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]Walk! It is incredibly hard to find parking in Hoboken. Some places to find parking are Sinatra Drive by the Hudson River, or any street named after a president (besides Washington). The city-run parking garages on Hudson Street and elsewhere are also a good option if you're worried about getting booted. The parking garages generally range from $3-5 an hour and prices jump up if you leave the car overnight. Some of the parking garages are also either for Hoboken residents or available in monthly payments only so, read the signs and ask people at the parking garages to double check.\n\nBesides walking, the **Citibike** system allows users to ride bikes and between bike stations in Hoboken. It is integrated into New York City and Jersey City's **Citibike** system, so bikes, accounts, passes, and keys can be used interchangeably. The Frank Sinatra Park and the Hudson River Walkway are examples of nice places to bike. It is important to mention that the previous bike share system that existed in Hoboken, **Hudson Bike Share**, is *no longer in operation as of 2020* and there are no longer docks present anywhere in Hudson County outside of Hoboken or Jersey City.\n\nIf you **must** park, read the signs on the street. Make sure that you are allowed to park where you're leaving your car. Most streets have one side reserved for Hoboken Residents, that are marked clearly with a green background and white letters. These are Resident Only parking sides and you must have a resident permit to park there. Street cleaning restrictions are in effect as well as a time limit of 4 hours for non-residents - after that, you should move your car.\n\nFinding a parking spot is so hard in Hoboken that they sell parking spaces for up to $40,000.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]With a great assortment of prewar buildings, Hoboken is a great place to wander on foot.\n\n- The\n**Hudson River Waterfront Walkway**offers a great view of New York City (day or night). - The\n**parks**on 4th & park and 11th & Hudson both were used as locations and can be easily recognized from the film even in their modern state. “I coulda’ been a contender....“ - Join in\n**holiday celebrations**in Hoboken. The city is full of people and celebrations when the holidays come around. New Years and 4th of July are two of the biggest holidays pulling in enormous crowds. The crowds gather for the numerous bars in Hoboken and to watch the beautiful fireworks show over the water. The fireworks are set off in the city but spectacular views of the fireworks can be seen from Hoboken, especially Pier A (mentioned above). Another huge holiday celebrated in Hoboken is St. Patrick's Day. Every year they hold a city parade where masses of people gather and wandering down main roads to stop at all the bars. - 1 Elysian Fields, 11th st at Washington St. Site of the first baseball game. In 1984, 100 years after the original ballpark closed, the Hoboken Industry and Business Association (HIBA) placed a plaque for the field's significance\n- 2 Frank Sinatra's Birthplace (From Here to Eternity), 415 Monroe St. Marked by a bronze plaque in the sidewalk. The wooden building where he was born was damaged in a fire and demolished in 1967.\n- 3 Erie-Lackawanna Terminal (Hoboken Terminal), 1 Hudson Pl (Accessible from NJ Transit, Light Rail, and PATH Trains). One of the busiest train stations in New Jersey, the Hoboken Terminal was built in 1907 and is owned by New Jersey Transit. The terminal was named after the now defunct Erie-Lackawanna Company, which had trains departing from this station that went as far as Illinois, and ferries across the Hudson River to New York City. The terminal (which has been used as a filming place for many music videos, movies and TV shows) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Today, it is one of only two historic intermodal stations on the Hudson Waterfront that still stand, and the only one to still be in use as a train station. Now, the trains that depart from this terminal go to many notable places in the area including Montclair State University, Newark's Penn Station, and, most significantly, New York City.\n- 4 Sybil's Cave (Get off at the Hoboken terminal and walk for 15 minutes along the waterfront). Hidden cave along the Hoboken waterfront that was discovered in the 1830s and closed in 1880. You're not allowed to go inside the cave because it's gated\n- 5 Point of Embarkation, Pier A Park. Before Pier A Park existed, Hoboken's terminal was twice its size and was a dock for ships for cargo and it was also the dock for ships that sent soldiers to Normandy, Somme and several other battle locations for World War I. The Point of Embarkation is a stone that was placed on the original location of the docks in 1975 while the docks were still there. The docks were transformed into Pier A Park in 1999.\n- 6 Hoboken Historical Museum, 1301 Hudson St, ☏ +1 201 656 2240, info@hobokenmuseum.org. Learn about the history of Hoboken from Dutch colonization to now. Budget.\n- 7 American Expeditionary Forces Memorial Boulder (Within walking distance from Hoboken Terminal).\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]- Walk down Washington Street, there are many shops and restaurants here.\n- Stop in\n**Tunes**and buy some music, a nice little music shop. - Walk/jog/rollerblade along the\n**Hudson River**. The running path extends north to Weehawken (nicer, greener), and south through Jersey City to Liberty State Park (with short inland section). In summer/fall, water is available from water fountains. - If you ride skateboards or rollerblades, there is a small\n**skatepark**along the Hudson River (with spectacular Manhattan views) about 1 mile north of the PATH station. - Indoor\n**climb**at Gravity Vault (Clinton St and 14th). - 1 Pier A Park (Next to Hoboken Train Station). Offers great views of New York City. On a clear day the incredible panorama visible from the end of the pier stretches between the George Washington and Verrazano Narrows Bridges. In the summer months around 5-6PM, one can often see huge cruise ships sailing by on their way out to sea en route to Bermuda and Canada. If you are an early riser (or up very late) the views of sunrise silhouetting the city from Pier A is unforgettable. It is also the perfect place to view the “Tribute in Light” (if they continue to do it) remembering the anniversary of September 11. Hoboken lost more of its residents in September 11th than any city other than New York. A memorial grove and flame shaped memorial is set up on Pier A to remember their sacrifice. There are various parks spanning the waterfront from Pier A, all the way up to 15th Street. Maxwell Park is the newest addition on Sinatra Drive.\n\n## Buy\n\n[edit]- 1 Washington St (take the NY Waterway from either W 39th St or Battery Park to Hoboken, then walk a few blocks straight).\n\n## Eat\n\n[edit]- 1 Sri Thai, 234 Bloomfield St (3rd and Bloomfield), ☏ +1 201 798-4822.

The bakery focuses on specialties such as wedding and birthday cakes, but is busy almost every morning with crowds lining up for their freshly made pastries and cookies. Prices vary greatly so you will have to stop by the bakery.\n- 8 Vito's Italian Deli, 806 Washington Street (corner w/ 8th St) (from the Pulaski Skyway or Newark Bay Extension, turn left on Jersey Ave (first traffic light); follow Jersey Ave, until it becomes Newark St., then make a left on Washington St), ☏ +1-201-792-4944, toll-free: +1 201-659-7222, mutzman8@yahoo.com.

Leo's is known for being one of the restaurants Frank Sinatra frequently visited in Hoboken and his seat is always on display.\n\n## Drink\n\n[edit]Hoboken has occasionally been called \"Bartown\" which is a well deserved nickname since it has more liquor licenses per capita than any other town in New Jersey. There is a huge range of lounges and bars in a very compact area. Many Hoboken restaurants do not have liquor licenses, so they allow you to BYO wine and beer with no corkage fee. This can save you a considerable sum since a good bottle of wine can be purchased at nearby bottle shops for less than $10!\n\nThere are dozens of bars within a few minutes walk of the PATH station catering to every taste in boozing. Gay, straight, cover bands, pick up, meat market, stuffy, seedy, trendy, you name it. Happy hours at many Hoboken establishments are a good deal. So if you want to get a buzz on the cheap, show up before 7PM or 8PM.\n\n- 1 The Cuban, 333 Washington Street, ☏ +1 201 795-9899, the_cuban@yahoo.com.\n- 2 Wilton House, 58 Newark St (A few blocks north from the Hoboken Terminal), ☏ +1 201-683-3431.

Of course if you are hammered from a night of hitting the pubs, sleep on the train! Otherwise, head back to Route 3 by the Lincoln Tunnel approach for an assortment of fleabag motor inns, or go into the riverfront area of Jersey City just south of Hoboken for higher class accommodations like the Hyatt, Courtyard, etc.\n\n- 1 W Hoboken, 225 River St, ☏ +1 201-253-2400. Upscale and expensive, but with great views of Hudson river and close to the train and ferry terminal.\n\n## Go next\n\n[edit]Take the PATH (subway), Bus #126 or the Lincoln or Holland Tunnels (car) to New York City.\n\nNJ Railways has numerous lines departing from Hoboken Terminal to places all over NJ and connecting to Newark Station, where you can connect to Amtrak and Newark Airport.\n\nRoutes through Hoboken |\n\nRidgewood ← Secaucus ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nDover ← Newark ← |\nW E |\n→ END |\nSpring Valley ← Secaucus ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nEND ← |\nN S |\n→ Jersey City → Bayonne |\nNorth Bergen ← Weehawken ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nNorth Bergen ← Weehawken ← |\nN S |\n→ Jersey City → END |\nEND ← |\nSW NE |\n→ Greenwich Village, Manhattan → Theater District, Manhattan |\nEND ← |\nNW SE |\n→ Jersey City → Financial District, Manhattan |"}
{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Jersey_Shore", "title": "Jersey_Shore", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore", "text": "Probably the most famous and popular destination in New Jersey, the Jersey Shore is a popular oceanfront escape for landlubbers of Metro New York and the Delaware Valley. The shore is also popular with other states in the northeast, including parts of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and even the Canadian province of Quebec.\n\nFor New Jerseyans, heading 'down the shore' (never 'to the beach') is a classic summer tradition that sometimes stretches back generations. Many families own, or more often, rent shore houses and stay for a week or two in the summer months of June, July and August. Towns along the coastline vary from large-scale, flashy, amusement-based boardwalks to smaller, quiet and laid-back seaside communities.\n\nThe counties of the Jersey Shore also include points further west, including portions of the Pine Barrens.\n\n## Counties\n\n[edit]## Cities\n\n[edit]- 1 Red Bank\n- 2 Long Branch (New Jersey)\n- 3 Asbury Park\n- 4 Spring Lake\n- 5 Point Pleasant Beach\n- 6 Seaside Heights\n- 7 Atlantic City\n- 8 Wildwood — the ultimate vacation spot for families, with great dining, nightlife, free beaches and plenty of fun for the whole family.\n- 9 Cape May — Victorian town at the southern tip of New Jersey.\n\n## Other destinations\n\n[edit]## Understand\n\n[edit]The culture of the Jersey Shore is quite different from that of the rest of the state. The locals are far gentler and more easygoing. They live and let live. They respect nature and treasure it. Some visitors appreciate that, and respect the local culture. Too many don't. You won't be surprised to know how strongly the locals feel about that.\n\nYou will enjoy your visit much more if you adopt the local ways. Speak softly. Listen. Be gentle with everyone. Obey the laws. Take the time to explore the natural wonders like migratory birds, the Pine Barrens, and sunrise on the beach. Don't kill anything except to eat. Never litter.\n\n### History\n\n[edit]In 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano believed he discovered the New Jersey coastline, but it was already inhabited by the Native Americans. New Jersey continued to grow over the next couple hundred years while being fought over by the Dutch, Swedes, and English. It was not until the 1900s that the New Jersey shore became prosperous and popular. In 1916, there was a deadly heat wave that hit the New Jersey area. Thousands of people flocked to the shore for a break from the heat. But in July of that year, 4 people were killed and one injured in shark attacks. Although these attacks scared off some tourists, the New Jersey shore was already a favorite among many others. During the Great Depression, the shore became an ideal vacation spot for both the rich and the poor. While the poor usually traveled for day trips, the rich could relax in the shore's most luxurious hotels.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the New Jersey shore became a popular destination for families and young adults looking for a great time during spring break for schools and colleges.\n\n### The 'Down The Shore' Myth\n\n[edit]Some Northern New Jerseyans and Philadelphians talk about going \"down the shore.\" The locals simply say they're going \"to the beach.\"\n\nThe natives tend to be extremely wary of the out-of-towners, or *Bennies*, who invade their beaches, make too much noise, litter, destroy property, trample dunes, and otherwise damage the natural environment. Bennies can officially be defined as a tourist who visits the Jersey Shore from **B**ayonne, **E**lizabeth, **N**ewark, or **N**ew York. At shore towns in southern NJ (ex: Ocean City, Sea Isle, etc), you may hear the term **shoobie** to describe aggressive out-of-towners from Pennsylvania and New York (named for their stereotypical habit of bringing lunches from home in shoeboxes).\n\n**Guido** is another popular term associated with the Jersey Shore. Often used interchangeably with \"Benny\", a Guido refers specifically to out-of-towners in their 20s who are loud, obnoxious, drink, and are generally considered meat heads (As seen on TV). As opposed to Bennie which can be referred to any out-of-towner from the New York Area. A Guido is a specific kind of benny that locals can not stand. Do not associate with these idiots, locals are trying hard to prove to the rest of the country that they are not like the buffoons the media likes to call them.\n\nBut if you are polite and respectful, they will respond. They might even point you in the right direction to have a good time. Don't try to use any beach slang. There is none. Also, the \"New Jersey Accent\" is mostly found in North New Jersey, most people along the Jersey Shore have a standard American accent and will take offense if you start imitating Tony Soprano.\n\n## Talk\n\n[edit]English is the predominant language at all of the New Jersey shore destinations. However, Spanish is also used. The New Jersey Shore is most commonly referred to as the \"shore\" by people who live in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware. However, people who live in these beach destinations often think it is tacky to call it the shore, and refer to it as the beach. One way for a local to tell if someone is from out of town, is by what they call the beaches.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]### By car\n\n[edit]Most shoregoers will travel by car, usually on the Garden State Parkway (from North Jersey/New York) and the Atlantic City Expressway (from South Jersey). The Garden State Parkway is 173 mi (278 km) long and runs north and south along the state’s eastern seaboard from Cape May north and ultimately connects to the New York State Thruway. The Atlantic City Expressway operates 47 mi (76 km) of roadway and connects the Delaware Valley and Philadelphia metropolitan area with Atlantic City and other South Jersey communities. An alternate route for travelers from the northwest to the southern shore points is to use Route 55, which runs from the Camden/Philadelphia area to the Millville area, not far from Cape May and Wildwood. Travelers from the west can take I-95 to I-195 east to Route 138 toward the shore points.\n\n**Parking**\nStreet parking at many of the beaches north of Atlantic City is free. South of A.C., and including A.C., the streets close to the beach are metered. There are also lots that charge daily and nightly fees.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]The N.J. Transit operates buses to some Jersey Shore destinations from New York, North Jersey and Philadelphia. Some routes are run more frequently or are only available during the summer. Coach buses can also be accessed with Academy Bus Lines, Coach USA, and Suburban Trails Bus Co.\n\n### By train\n\n[edit]Shore points from Long Branch to Bay Head are accessible by New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line, which runs from Penn Station. The Atlantic City Line also serves the area, offering service from Philadelphia. For more information, see NJ Transit's website . Since a number of stations are small, you will need to arrange for transportation to your destination.\n\n### By plane\n\n[edit]The closest International airports are Atlantic City International **ACY** IATA, Philadelphia International **PHL** IATA, and Newark International **EWR** IATA. Smaller airports for private planes, small corporate jets, forest fire planes, the Civil Air Patrol and emergency services aircraft include RJ Miller Airport, Central Jersey Airport, and Monmouth Executive Airport.\n\n### By boat\n\n[edit]Jersey shore destinations can be reached by boat via the New York Waterway. The Belford Terminal ferry can hold 500 cars and runs to Pier 11, Wall Street. The Seastreak serves Atlantic Highlands, Highlands & Pier 11 Wall Street and East 34th Street, NYC. The Cape May-Lewes Ferry runs between Cape May and Lewes, Delaware. It holds both foot passengers and cars and is a seventy minute trip.\n\nThe Farley State Marina is located in Atlantic City, NJ and managed by The Golden Nugget. The Marina provides 640 floating docks and can dock yachts up to 300 ft (91 m) in length. It is located 44 mi (71 km) statute from Cape May and 64 mi (103 km) statute offshore from the Manasquan Inlet. The harbor is well protected with no wakes and little current.\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]Most houses are within a reasonable walk from the beach, although there may be a major road crossing required.\n\nNJ Transit offers trains along the North Jersey Coast route between Newark and Bay Head, New Jersey. Trains depart every 1-3 hours.\n\nA car is easier to get around (especially to procure groceries or other necessities), but going to the beach itself may require money for parking lots or meters (varies by town).\n\nBike rentals are available at almost every Jersey Shore destination. Get the beach feel riding around on your Beach or Boardwalk Cruiser! Also, some beach spots have Surrey rentals.\n\nAtlantic City features such means of getting around as Trolley tours, Royal Rolling Chairs and Jitney Shuttles.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]Summer after summer, the Jersey Shore lures travelers with its blue skies, refreshing breezes and 127 mi (204 km) of beautiful, white sandy beaches. It is one of the most desired year-round travel and vacation destinations on the East Coast. For the excitement of fun and fast nightlife, there’s Atlantic City with its many casinos and night clubs. For laid back family fun, enjoy famous boardwalks like Wildwood, and Ocean City. Whether it’s Sandy Hook, Cape May or one of the diverse shore areas in between, you’ll find world-famous resorts, an abundance of historical sites, legacies and breathtaking scenery at the Jersey Shore.\n\nThere are many lighthouses scattered across the Jersey Shore, including the Barnegat Lighthouse.\n\n- Barnegat Light. \"Old Barney\" is located 45 miles (72 km) south of Sandy Hook, at the north end of Long Beach Island, at Barnegat Inlet.

Guided Dune Walks are offered by Wetlands Institute staff\n\n- Navesink. A double lighthouse that sits like a fortress over the northern tip of the Jersey Shore. Complete with a cannon, a tower to climb, a huge rotating light beacon, a museum, and, of course, a gift shop, a visit to the Twin Lights will be sure to interest visitors of all ages. The Twin Lights is so named because it is two lighthouses attached to one structure. One of the lighthouses, the North Tower, is open regularly for visits; the other, the South Tower, only on select occasions, such as the NJ Shore Lighthouse Challenge. ,\n- Lucy the Elephant in Margate.\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]Most of the beaches on the Shore require a **beach badge** to enter. The badges are purchased for a fee, and are only good for the town in which they were purchased (e.g. a badge bought in Belmar would not be good in Seaside Heights). Badges may be valid for 1 day, a week, or an entire season. These fees go towards beach maintenance. Some hotels may offer guests complimentary badges as a perk. A few communities do not charge for the beach, most notably Atlantic City and Wildwood.\n\n### Monmouth County\n\n[edit]- Allenhurst has a \"hometown\" feel.\n- Asbury Park — A rock destination of the 1970s and 1980s, this seaside town is enjoying a cultural renaissance.

Between cafes, restaurants, and boardwalk shops, one can find exotic international delights, gourmet specialties, seafood, steaks, vegetarian, all American cuisine and traditional takeout.\n\nThere are also some great restaurants where one can sit waterside and enjoy the gorgeous view as they enjoy their meal. Try the *Pilot House* for lunch, dinner, and Sunday brunch. If you prefer fine dining, give the *Water's Edge* a try, they are right on the bay. Of course when you are on the boardwalk, you have to eat some of the hot dogs, steak sandwiches, pizza, and drink some of the \"fresh squeezed\" lemonade. Don’t forget the caramel corn and famous salt water taffy, which the original recipe originated in Atlantic City. In Ocean City, visitors can watch salt water taffy being pulled at the store front of *Shriver's* on the boardwalk. After driving over the 9th Street bridge in Ocean City, you can't miss the *Chatterbox*, a bright pink restaurant, welcoming visitors to the shore and serving excellent food. Also, don't forget to eat at *Mack and Manco's*, one of the most popular pizza stops on the boards. A visit to the shore is never complete without a pound of Laura's Fudge, at 9th and Asbury. If you travel to Seaside Heights, you have to try the very large pizza at the Saw Mill or Three brothers. It is excellent and 1 slice is more than enough! Wildwood is home to some fantastic zeppoles and Italian sausage and pepper sandwiches. One big thing about visiting the Jersey Shore and its many boardwalks, promenades and snack bars is that anything can be fried, and it will be delicious. Oreos, candy bars, twinkies and those amazing intertangled webs of dough we know as funnel cakes can all be enjoyed down the shore.\n\nUpon visiting the Jersey Shore, it is necessary to try a Pork Roll sandwich. Pork roll is a breakfast meat rarely found anywhere except New Jersey and Philadelphia. A common pork roll treat is the \"Jersey Shore Breakfast\" which consists of pork roll, egg and cheese often on a bagel or English muffin. Pork roll originated in Trenton in 1856 and has been a Jersey tradition ever since.\n\nAnother Jersey Shore staple is Wawa, a convenience store providing a variety of fresh foods for breakfast and lunch. Along with customized sandwiches and fresh salads, Wawa also provides award-winning coffee at a very low price. Customers throughout the Mid-Atlantic enjoy the convenience of Wawa.\n\n## Drink\n\n[edit]Seaside Heights has an excellent selection of bars and clubs.\n\nOcean City is a \"dry\" town- it has no bars. Sea Isle City is the place to go for bars with cover bands, karaoke, happy hour, and so on. The Ocean Drive has a \"No-Shower Happy-Hour\" where it is customary to go there right from the beach- wet hair, bathing suit/wet suit, flip-flops, cover ups, what ever. There are a number of restaurants all along the beach and Landis Ave from 35th street to 50th street. Some of the pizza places are open until 3AM or later and are great for wings, pizza and so on after a night out. The Springfield is right on the beach and has an outdoor bar and good food. Some new Italian places have opened up along with BBQ places. The area down by Fisherman's Wharf is alive with delicious, fresh seafood made to order in classic recipes that excentuate the natural, flavorful, taste of ocean fare.\n\n## Stay safe\n\n[edit]Ocean City is a \"dry\" town. There are no bars. Sea Isle City is the place to go for cover bands and bars.\n\nUse caution in Asbury Park at night. While the areas around the bars in Asbury are safe, some of the city's residential neighborhoods are less hospitable for outsiders. Also, the highways are extremely dangerous, due to tourist traffic as well as drunk drivers. Police are known to enforce traffic laws vigorously in some smaller towns. Expect to be hit with a hefty fine or possible license suspension if you're caught driving under the influence. Police will also ticket more aggressively than the rest of the state (especially in summer) for parking infractions and driving above the speed limit.\n\nAlthough Asbury Park is a major LGBT tourist destination, be aware that the rest of the Jersey Shore (with the exception of Atlantic City) is *extremely conservative*. Intolerance towards LGBT people is uncommon but a definite possibility and being openly gay or transgender on many boardwalks may invite unwanted attention. Local police tend to be very indifferent towards LGBT issues, even though NJ has strong hate crime and anti-discrimination protections for sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nWildwood, while generally safe near the boardwalk, has some neighborhoods that aren't as nice as those in most other shore towns. Serious crime against tourists is rare, but use common sense and try to avoid walking alone late at night, especially in the unlit neighborhoods more than a block or two from the boardwalk.\n\nAtlantic City has some crime problems, but these areas are far away from the Boardwalk. Panhandlers on the Boardwalk may become annoying, since there is so many of them, but if you don't want to give anything, just keep walking. Casinos are safe due to the high number of security personnel and video cameras. Do not explore Atlantic City at night. All night life is limited to the casinos.\n\n## Go next\n\n[edit]When you visit the New Jersey shore there are many nearby attractions and destinations to visit. All of these places can be seen in one-day trips.\n\n- The rest of the Raritan Bayshore\n- New York City\n- Medford\n- Camden\n- Delmarva, including Lewes\n- Cherry Hill\n- Philadelphia"}
{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Fort_Lee", "title": "Fort_Lee", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Fort_Lee", "text": "**Fort Lee** is a city in Bergen County. This town is comprised of a large residential community that includes Fort Lee natives, transplants from New York, and immigrants, especially from Korea. This cultural diversity is represented through the vast variety of international restaurants and small business, and in particular, there is a strong Korean presence that can be seen in retail and dining storefronts.\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]Fort Lee sits between the Paramus, NJ retail corridor and Upper Manhattan.\n\nFort Lee is a city of 40,000 (2020 Census) that is piled high with apartment buildings. Because Fort Lee sits above the banks of the Hudson River, there are breathtaking views from almost any window facing the river. The New York City skyline and 4th of July fireworks are spectacular over the river. Although it is highly built up, Fort Lee has many playing fields and recreational parks as well as bike and running trails. And although there is a great deal of vehicle traffic to and from the George Washington Bridge, which connects Fort Lee with Manhattan, one of the largest perks of this town is the walking access to many restaurants, convenience stores and mass transit, in the form of buses and vans that frequently run across the bridge and up and down major streets.\n\nThis article also covers the neighboring community of **Palisades Park**.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]Fort Lee is bordered by seven municipalities in New Jersey. To the north, there’s Englewood, Englewood Cliffs. To the south, there’s Cliffside Park, Edgewater. To the west, there’s Ridgefield, Leonia, Palisades Park. The Hudson River forms its eastern boundary, as well as the state line with New York. Across the Hudson River, it also borders the upper Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights in New York, NY.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]Being the home to the George Washington Bridge, it’s understandable Fort Lee would be easy to traverse in a car, whether passing by or doing local travel. In transit to the city, most of the highways cut through the northern neighborhoods and residential areas, such as: Interstate 95 and the New Jersey Turnpike, US Highway 1-9, US Highway 46, and NJ State Route 4. The Palisades Interstate Parkway also runs north-south of the city, heading north along the Palisades after entering New Jersey, while US Highway 9W runs parallel to the PIP going north of Fort Lee. Together, I-95/New Jersey Turnpike, US Highway 1-9, US Highway 46, US Highway 9W, and NJ State Route 67 (running above those aforementioned highways on a north-south route) form the George Washington Bridge Plaza, where all of those highways converge from the GWB toll plaza, to the bridge crossing over to New York. If coming from New York City, take the George Washington Bridge; Fort Lee is the first town on the New Jersey side of the bridge, and the first of several exits for those highways.\n\n### By bus or jitney\n\n[edit]Fort Lee’s primary bus stop is at the foot of the George Washington Bridge Bus Plaza (GWBP), where there’s bus service offered by New Jersey Transit, Rockland Coaches, or Spanish Transportation (“dollar buses/vans” usually with a green color). Eastbound, all routes go to either the George Washington Bus Station in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, or to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan. Westbound, the destinations would usually differ between the different transit carriers. New Jersey Tranist buses transport their customers between local stops in Fort Lee, and out of town in Bergen/Passaic/Hudson Counties. Rockland Coaches offers service between Fort Lee and Rockland County, New York. Spanish Transportation offers bus routes either on their Route 4 service, terminating at Paterson’s Broadway Bus Terminal, or their Bergenline service, traveling down Bergeline Avenue to Jersey City’s Newport Mall. Some of New Jersey Transit’s buses run for 24 hours.\n\nAsk any bus or jitney driver leaving from the Port Authority George Washington Bus Station on 177 St. whether s/he can let you off in Fort Lee.\n\n### By ferry\n\n[edit]Although there isn’t a ferry in the city, Fort Lee can also be accessed by boat or ferry from New York City via Edgewater (Edgewater Ferry Landing) and Weehawken (Port Imperial Ferry) docks, on the NY Waterway service.\n\n### By plane\n\n[edit]The nearest airports to Fort Lee are Newark Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Teterboro (**TEB** IATA) (general aviation only), JFK and Westchester County Airport.\n\n### On foot\n\n[edit]With the George Washington Bridge not only doubling as an iconic landmark for the city, but as a crucial connection to New York City’s northern neighborhoods (and beyond), it allows for pedestrian and bike travel, with two different walkways (north, or south). From 6AM-midnight, the paths are open for travelers to walk between Fort Lee, and New York City, usually the south walkway is opened unless if maintenance or construction is done. On average, it would take 20-25 minutes to traverse the nearly 1 mile span, and 10 minutes (or less) on bike. The north walkway has a convenient pathway to the Palisades Interstate Park, while the south walkway is in easy reach of Fort Lee Historic Park.\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]Most people choose cars, but if headed to a central area, such as Main Street, it is best to drive there, park in a municipal parking lot, and walk around from there. Since so much of the town's retail area is clustered in 3- or 4-block radius, it would be beneficial to walk around, but might also be dangerous given the high traffic intersections. If walking use caution, and if parking, make sure to feed the meter with plenty of pocket change; the meter maids take their job very seriously. Since Fort Lee is situated in such a convenient area for those commuting to and from the city, there is often high traffic and congestion on the roads. If you are planning on being somewhere at a certain time, one might suggest leaving a good 10 to 15 minutes to escape local traffic before hitting any major roadways.\n\nFor local transportation or air-port/train station services, there are several local taxi companies that are reliable.\n\n-\n[dead link]A-1, 2470 Lemoine Ave, ☏ +1 201 944-3737. - Babe's, 185 Bridge Plaza North, ☏ +1 201 944-6800.\n- G W Taxi, 1696 Bergen Blvd, ☏ +1 201 363-0555.\n\n## See\n\n[edit]Fort Lee is known and named for the story of how General George Washington was forced to evacuate the area in November 1776 and begin his famous retreat through New Jersey during the winter of 1776-77 in the protection of \"Fort Lee\".The Visitors' Center provides information on the role of Fort Lee in the War.

{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Newark", "title": "Newark", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Newark", "text": "*For other places with the same name, see Newark (disambiguation).*\n\n**Newark** is New Jersey's largest city and second largest in Metro New York. Although one of the great historic cities of the Northeast and the most culture-rich city in the state, Newark is often overlooked in favor of Goliath-like Manhattan and towns along the Hudson River, such as Jersey City and Hoboken. While no longer the industrial powerhouse it once was, Newark remains one of America's major shipping, rail, and air hubs. Public transportation is abundant, making it easy to get to, from, and around the city.\n\nNewark has been economically disadvantaged for some time, and suffers from a bad reputation, often informed by negative stereotyping. Thanks in large part to a nationally high-profile mayor (Cory Booker, now a U.S. Senator), committed populace, and changing attitudes towards once decaying urban areas, the often proclaimed, but stunted renaissance of Newark is steadily and substantially taking hold.\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]English is the main language, but the Ironbound area is home to a significant Brazilian and Portuguese population.\n\nNewark, NJ, is pronounced \"Noo-wirk\", as opposed to Newark, Delaware, which is pronounced \"Noo-ark\". Locals will often pronounce it \"Nork\" or \"Nerk\".\n\n### History\n\n[edit]The city was founded in the year 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony. It was named after Newark-on-Trent in England. Three centuries later, the population grew rapidly. Industry also grew constantly. The city even had its own Chinatown. However, in the 20th century, many raids took place, and much of the Chinese population went away to other areas, causing Newark's Chinatown to fade away. Things only got worse as more racial tension and riots occurred in the city. In the 1990s, the city went through tons of revitalization efforts. Today, the city has grown back into an important industrial hub, however some things such as the old Chinatown and the city's good reputation were forever lost. Despite this, the city still shines with culture and history, and also has the oldest county park in the United States, Branch Brook Park. There is also a huge Portuguese and Brazilian population in Ironbound. Although the city is usually overlooked by Manhattan and it is not the glimmering gem it used to be, the city is still worth a visit.\n\n### Districts\n\n[edit]The city is divided into five wards, each with its own character. Downtown has retained much of early 20th century architecture and has an iconic skyline. Nearly 100,000 people commute to the central business district on workdays, making for a lively urban landscape. Since the millennium it has become more residential as former office buildings and warehouses are converted to housing. A new performing arts complex and sports/concert venue and restaurants have encouraged visitors to linger longer into the night, particularly along Halsey Street and Edison Street. The North Ward is home to Branch Brook Park, site of the nation's largest collection of cherry blossom trees, and the neo-Gothic Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Surrounding neighborhoods include architecturally interesting suburban enclaves on the east and bustling urban districts on the west.\n\nThe East Ward, or the Ironbound, is home to a large Portuguese/Brazilian community, with a \"restaurant row\" offering a cornucopia of eating establishments for every budget.\n\nThe South Ward, once the heart of the Jewish community and home to the Weequahic Park and architectural gems, has fallen on hard times, and is where much of the city's crime is concentrated.\n\nThe West Ward, including Vailsburg, is a working and middle class neighborhood.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]Newark has great transportation, and is very easy to get into and out of.\n\n### By plane\n\n[edit]1 Newark Liberty International Airport (**EWR** IATA) is about 5 mi (8 km) south of downtown. It is a major hub for United Airlines, and is served by numerous other domestic and international carriers. **JFK International Airport** (**JFK** IATA) and **LaGuardia Airport** (**LGA** IATA) are in Queens, New York, and are served by additional carriers who do not fly to EWR directly. Airport information can be obtained by calling +1-888-EWR-INFO or +1 973-961-6000.\n\n**AirTrain Newark** shuttles between the airport's parking facilities, three terminals, and train station, where frequent New Jersey Transit (NJT) service is a ten minute ride to downtown. NJT bus #62 and the limited stop GoBus 28 also both travel to downtown, the latter with continuing service to North Newark.\n\nTaxi service is based on a flat-fee determined by destination and paid before the trip begins.\n\n### By train\n\n[edit]- 2 Newark Penn Station (Amtrak code NWK,\n**ZRP**IATA), 1 Raymond Plaza West. Is located just a few blocks from the heart of downtown Newark. It's a beautiful old McKim Mead & White building and worth visiting just on its own.

Online outlets include:\n\n*The Newark Times*[dead link]is the premiere online news media platform dedicated to Newark news, lifestyle, events, and culture*TAP Into Newark*is an online news site devoted to Newark*Brick City Live*[dead link]is a site focused on Newark news, lifestyle and perspectives*Newark Patch*is a daily online news source dedicated to local Newark news*NewarkPulse.com*[dead link]brands itself as the most popular Newark-based events and happenings website*NJ Metro*[dead link], a journalism project at Rutgers Newark, covers metropolitan life in Newark, Northern New Jersey and New York City*City of Newark Twitter*shares news and events via its official account\n\n## Stay safe\n\n[edit]Ever since the infamous Newark riots in the 1960s, the city has been plagued by a somewhat undeserved reputation for high crime and murders. However, crime has dropped significantly in Newark; in fact the city’s overall crime rate is stooping down to record lows not seen in decades. Still, Newark has its share of persisting problems like any other big city. Car theft and car jackings are the biggest crimes in Newark, followed by home invasions. Downtown Newark is crowded and safe during the day. It empties out at night and may seem creepy, but as long as you stay in well lit open areas you should be fine. The Ironbound district has most of the great restaurants and is busy on nights and weekends and is probably the safest part of the city, behind Downtown and residential Forest Hill. If you were to go to an event at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the New Jersey Symphony Hall, or the Prudential Center, you should be fine. They are well lit areas with a police presence and are the safest part of the city.\n\nThe North, Central, and especially South Wards have heavier crime rates and it pays to be more guarded in those areas.\n\nAlthough bustling during peak travel hours and almost completely safe in daylight, Newark Broad Street station (NJ Transit) can be very dangerous after hours and through the night when fewer people wait for trains (usually from 10PM-5AM). Armed robberies are common and can occur even when you are not the only one waiting for a late train. If you do find yourself at the station after hours, wait in the lobby beneath the platform, or failing that, one of the lit waiting booths on the platform. Do NOT display cell phones or iPods.\n\n## Cope\n\n[edit]### Consulates\n\n[edit]- Colombia, 550 Broad Street, 15th floor, ☏ +1 862-279-7888, fax: +1 862-279-7885, cnewark@cancilleria.gov.co.\n- Ecuador, 400 Market Street, 4th Floor, ☏ +1 973-344-6900, cecunewjersey@cancilleria.gob.ec. 9:30AM-2:30PM.\n- Portugal, 1 Riverfront Plaza, The Legal Center, Main Floor, ☏ +1 973-643-4200, fax: +1 973-643-3900, mail@cnnew.dgaccp.pt.\n- Spain (Honorary).\n- Sri Lanka (Honorary).\n\n## Go next\n\n[edit]- Manhattan is easily accessible. The cheapest way is via the PATH train, from Newark Penn Station to World Trade Center or with a transfer at Journal Square (Jersey City) to the line which goes to Christopher St. and along 6th Avenue to 9th, 14th, 23rd and 33rd Streets. NJ Transit from Broad Street Station and Newark Penn Station takes you directly to the New York Penn Station in about 17 min.\n- The nearby city of Elizabeth, which offers plenty of shopping options including the Jersey Gardens shopping mall and IKEA, is only a short car ride away.\n- The Jersey Shore, with funky Asbury Park, Victorian Ocean Grove, and fishing town Manasquan is served by the North Jersey Coast Line, and is an easy day trip.\n- The Statue of Liberty National Monument includes Ellis Island, once America's busiest immigration station, and Liberty Island, home to the statue itself. Ferries depart from Liberty State Park in Jersey City, reached by taking PATH to Exchange Place and switching to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail.\n- Field Station: Dinosaurs theme park exhibition is within walking distance of Secaucus Junction, one stop from Newark Penn on NJ Transit trains.\n- Thomas Edison National Historical Park, which preserves Thomas Edison's laboratory and residence, is 6 miles (10 km) west of downtown Newark in West Orange.\n- St. John's Church, a Gothic Revival Roman Catholic church which houses outstanding 19th-century artworks and an historic pipe organ is located in the nearby City of Orange.\n\n**Hitchhike**\n\nBelieve it or not, it is possible to hitchhike out of the New York Metro area. If you are trying to go long distances, your best bet is to take NJ Transit or Metro North far enough to put you well into the suburbs, preferably to a stop that puts you near (within walking distance of) a major highway such as an Interstate. From there, get to an on-ramp and put out your thumb. New Jersey Statutes 39:4-59 on hitchhiking is notoriously prohibitive, and you will be hassled by local police, so use common sense and discretion. If you're trying to go west into Pennsylvania, your best bet is to take NJ transit to Mt. Olive, which is only a 5-min walk from I-80, which generally carries a good amount of long-distance traffic going west.\n\nRoutes through Newark (by car) |\n\nAllentown ← Summit ← Union ← |\nW E |\n→ Bayonne → Jersey City → New York City |\nNew York City ← Teaneck ← Secaucus ← |\nN S |\n→ Elizabeth → Trenton → Philadelphia |\nStroudsburg ← Parsippany ← East Orange ← |\nW E |\n→ Harrison → Ends at |\nSpring Valley ← Clifton ← East Orange ← |\nN S |\n→ Union → Toms River → Cape May |\nNew York City ← Fort Lee ← Jersey City ← |\nN S |\n→ Elizabeth → Princeton → Philadelphia |\nNew York City ← Fort Lee ← Jersey City ← |\nN S |\n→ Elizabeth → Freehold → Cape May |\nClifton ← Passaic ← Lyndhurst/Nutley ← |\nN S |\n→ END |\nEND ← |\nN S |\n→ Elizabeth → Edison → Princeton |\n\nRoutes through Newark (by long-distance rail) |\n\nWashington, D.C. ← Woodbridge ← |\nSW NE |\n→ New York City → Boston |\nPhiladelphia ← Trenton ← |\nW E |\n→ New York City → END |\nEND ← New York City ← |\nN S |\n→ Trenton → Philadelphia |\nPhiladelphia ← Newark Airport ← |\nW E |\n→ New York City → END |\nPhiladelphia ← Newark Airport ← |\nSW NE |\n→ New York City → New Haven |\nPhiladelphia ← Trenton ← |\nW E |\n→ New York City → END |\nPhiladelphia ← Woodbridge ← |\nSW NE |\n→ New York City → New Haven |\n\nRoutes through Newark (by subway/commuter rail) |\n\nDover ← Montclair ← |\nW E |\n→ Secaucus → New York City |\nDover ← East Orange ← |\nW E |\n→ Secaucus/Hoboken → New York City/END |\nWoodbridge ← Newark Airport ← |\nSW NE |\n→ Secaucus → New York City |\nHigh Bridge ← Cranford ← |\nW E |\n→ Secaucus → New York City |\nEND ← |\nW E |\n→ Harrison → Financial District, Manhattan |"}
{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Princeton", "title": "Princeton", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Princeton", "text": "*For other places with the same name, see Princeton (disambiguation).*\n\n**Princeton [dead link]**, home to the prestigious Princeton University, is a municipality with a population of approximately 32,000 (2017) in Mercer County, central New Jersey.\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]Princeton is a town filled with college students, beautiful scenery, and historical features.\n\nThe University's Nassau Hall served as the capital of the United States for a single summer in the late 18th century. Princeton counts among its former residents Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann.\n\n## Get in\n\n[edit]### By plane\n\n[edit]Princeton has an eponymous airport located in Montgomery, less than 2 miles from Nassau Street and Princeton University. Princeton Airport serves mostly general aviation (i.e. hobby) flying, but it also sees its fair share of business charter flights. It has one runway, fuel stations, lots of aircraft tie-down space, and hangars. This makes the airport a very cost-effective solution for travelers who pilot their own airplanes. Car-rental service is located on-site.\n\nOther nearby airports include the Somerset Airport, Central Jersey Regional Airport, and Teterboro airport (**TEB** IATA). These airports, like Princeton, do not operate commercial flights, but anyone with his/her own airplane can fly in.\n\nThe larger Trenton Mercer airport offers some air-taxi options.\n\n**Newark Liberty International Airport**(**EWR**IATA) is in Newark and is about 1 hour away by car. New Jersey Transit trains stop at EWR, so it's possible to reach Princeton from EWR without a car or taxi.**Philadelphia International Airport**(**PHL**IATA) is the largest airport in the Delaware Valley region and in Pennsylvania. It is about 1½ hours away by car.\n\n### By train\n\n[edit]A small rail station in close proximity to both the University campus and the downtown district provides a shuttle service, known locally as \"the Dinky,\" to the nearby Princeton Junction train station. At Princeton Junction, you can transfer to either Amtrak or New Jersey Transit trains. New Jersey Transit trains usually arrive and depart from the station every half-hour on weekdays, and hourly on weekends.\n\nPrinceton Junction station is about 4 miles southeast of the main university campus. It is served by the Northeast Corridor Line, the main commuter rail line running from Washington, D.C. to Boston. This line is often full during the morning and evening rush hours with commuters traveling to New York City or Philadelphia.\n\n#### From New York City\n\n[edit]From New York, be sure to purchase a NJ Transit Northeast Corridor line train ticket from Penn Station to Princeton (not Princeton Junction). As of October, 2021, it costs $16.00 for a one-way ride, including a ticket via the Princeton Shuttle. The southbound train from Penn Station will stop at Princeton Junction; disembark there and hold on to your ticket, as you'll need it to take the shuttle train (\"dinky\") from Princeton Junction to Princeton. The shuttle's Princeton terminus is at the south edge of campus, in close proximity to the newly (as of September 2017) erected arts center, theater, and music building. The average travel time from New York to Princeton would be 70-80 minutes, but delays, such as summer/winter construction would hamper it.\n\n#### Walking from the Dinky\n\n[edit]Reaching the center of campus from the Dinky is a bit tricky. To reach the center of campus (containing the Admissions Office, Nassau Hall, the University's oldest building, etc.), walk north from the station through a group of triangle-shaped buildings (I.M. Pei-designed Spelman College), continue north on a road past a gymnasium (on your right) and a dormitory (on your left). This road dead-ends in a loop behind another dormitory, continue walking north until you reach an immense staircase terminating at an archway; this is the Blair Arch. Walk up the stairs and continue eastward along the path. When you reach a white marble building (Clio Hall), the admissions office (West College) will be just to the north, on your left, and Nassau Hall will be further north. A stair-free, less confusing path, is to take the same path through Spelman, but walk behind the gym to a road through the center of campus (Elm Drive), which leads north to West College and Nassau Hall. Visitors may wish to visit the Frist Campus Center for a campus tour. Tours depart from the Welcome Desk on the main floor of the Campus Center (take the stairs down, not up, at the front of the building). To get to Frist from the Dinky Station, the least confusing (albeit far from the shortest) path is to take Elm Drive until one reaches an east-west path running behind a white marble building. Make a right (east) on this path, and walk until you reach a major street (Washington Road). Don't cross Washington; just turn right (south), and continue until you reach the Campus Center, which is easily recognizable by \"Fristhenge\", a thin brickcourse supported by pillars in front of the building. (Preferably, one would continue north on Elm Drive and ask for a map at West College.)\n\n- 1 Princeton railway station, Alexander St.\n\n### By bus\n\n[edit]Coach USA (under the name Suburban) offers bus service from New York and New Brunswick to Princeton.\n\nNew Jersey Transit operates several commuter bus lines connecting Princeton with other areas. Several bus stops are located throughout Princeton Borough and Township. Buses generally leave on every half-hour between 8:30AM and 9PM weekdays, and irregularly before and after those hours. The Saturday schedule is similar, and the Sunday schedule is hourly.\n\n### By car\n\n[edit]Two major highways, Route 206 and Route 27, pass through Princeton. U.S. Route 1 runs just east of the town while Interstate 95 and the New Jersey Turnpike are two alternative routes to get into the area.\n\nThe town's main street is Nassau Street, on which the majority of shops and eateries can be found. Although Princeton has parallel parking spaces along the main roads, most are metered and all are checked frequently by the infamously vigilant local parking patrol. The Princeton Parking Cash Card, available from machines in Spring Street Garage, conveniently pays for parking at all meters and allows for the reclamation of unused \"time\" upon return to the meter; \"max out\" the meter then take back unused credit upon return to forfend the award of parking tickets in the forty dollar range. There are multiple parking garages; the municipal garage on Spring Street, a few dozen feet from the Princeton Record Exchange, is the most affordable, but the pricier garages in Palmer Square and on Chambers Street are convenient to many locations as well. Sunday parking on the street is no longer free.\n\n## Get around\n\n[edit]Everything in the downtown area is easily accessible on foot from the main parts of the campus or the two hotels in town. A physically fit visitor can reach any part of town with a bicycle. The only public transit is a single bus line that makes a leisurely loop around the outer parts of the town. Taxis are easily available by cell phone, or at the taxi stand on Nassau St and Witherspoon.\n\nThe university operates several buses between campus, university housing, and several campus parking lots. These buses are for faculty, staff, students, and campus visitors, but no checking is done. See also the real-time bus map[dead link].\n\n## See\n\n[edit]**The University Campus**, with many attractive buildings in \"Collegiate Gothic\" style as well as colonial-era Nassau Hall (the temporary capitol of the United States for a summer) and the strikingly modern Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (formerly known as the Woodrow Wilson School) building. Don't miss the stately University Chapel with its stained glass and stone arches. The Princeton University Library has spectacular exhibits and standing collections you can get up close and personal. The Princeton University Art Museum also features an impressive collection of works by an array of well known and highly touted artists from throughout history. College tours start at the Frist College Center building; check website for times.**The Fountain of Freedom**, outside the white marble-columned School of Public and International Affairs building. The fountain is surrounded by a large pool. The pool is less than 2 feet deep, and there will often be children playing in the fountain. It is also a tradition for the University's marching band to play while standing in the fountain after Princeton football victories.**The Princeton Public Library**, corner of Wiggins and Witherspoon. The library has been at this location since the 1970s, but has been rebuilt as a state-of-the-art facility. It offers free Internet access to all if you need to check email or print a ticket. Its wireless network reaches out to the plaza for 24/7 access. Near many cafes and less than a quarter mile from Palmer Square.**19th century mansions**on Library Place, Elm Street, and nearby.- Small historical house museum at Bambridge House on Nassau Street.\n- 1 Albert Einstein's house, 112 Mercer St.. At his request there is no marker but it is the small, white, ordinary home located across Mercer Road from a small park. You can see it best on foot as Mercer is busy and there is nowhere to pull over. From Nassau Street, bear left onto Mercer. Walk past elegant row houses and a large church and continue past the campus of the Princeton Theological Seminary. At the bottom of the hill on the left side of the road, small homes front onto the road directly above the sidewalk. The second one you encounter was Einstein's.\n- The picturesque, 18th-century\n**Nassau Inn**in Palmer Square is worth visiting even for those not wealthy enough to book a room there. **Palmer Square**, in the center of town, is a small park featuring a large tree which is traditionally decorated for Christmas.**Princeton Cemetery**, in the geographic center of town, half a mile north of Nassau street.

{"id": "wikivoyage_nynj_Paterson", "title": "Paterson", "url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Paterson", "text": "*For the township in the Hunter region of New South Wales, see Paterson (New South Wales).*\n\n**Paterson** is New Jersey's third largest city (about 155,000 inhabitants as of 2022), and hosts a great attraction: the Great Falls, which are very extensive and second only to Niagara Falls in terms of volume of water in waterfalls east of the Mississippi. Paterson is 12 miles away from Manhattan. It is an ethnically diverse city that houses large Hispanic, Arab, Italian-American, African American and Bengali communities. South Paterson is home to one of the nation's largest Arab communities.\n\n## Understand\n\n[edit]Paterson was the nation's first planned industrial city. It was established in 1791. The Paterson falls were a key element in the success of Paterson as the industrial leader of the nation during this time. The 77-foot falls' power was harnessed and provided power for the many industries in Paterson. Paterson was a rich city and enjoyed success throughout the late 1700s, 1800s and early 1900s (up until the 1950s). Paterson was nicknamed the silk city for its dominant role in the production in silk during the mid 1800s.\n\nThe city began to decline during the 1960s and 1970s was due to several factors. Many industries during this time began moving to the Midwest, and at the same time, many African Americans were moving into the city from the south. Factories were closing at the same time African Americans moved in looking for employment. Many white residents began leaving the city due to the declining economy. The opening of malls in nearby Paramus and Wayne also took away significant business from the city's downtown shopping district.\n\nWith a crippled economy and high unemployment rate, Paterson was becoming a ghetto. During the 1980s, crime increased significantly in the city. Crime rates dropped in the 1990s, but still remain high. There are many efforts underway to help revive the city. Despite the city's bad reputation, high crime rates, and poverty, there are a lot of places to go and things to do in this city. The city is very diverse and contains a very high population of Hispanics of all nationalities, African Americans, Italian Americans, South Asians and Arabs. There are numerous parks, ethnic places to eat, shop, hang out, and see.\n\n### Neighborhoods\n\n[edit]This city has a number of distinctive neighborhoods:\n\n**Great Falls District** This is the district in which the Great Falls and Paterson Museum is located.

Open 24 hours. The tallest waterfall in New Jersey and the second largest by volume east of the Mississippi River (behind Niagara Falls). These falls were what helped Paterson grow as the first planned industrial city in the U.S. The falls provided power for the city at one time. The Great Falls today are part of a state park, but the feel is of a municipal park, with people of all hues enjoying the views, picnicking in good weather, and vendors selling items like good Latino ices. You can easily walk a half mile or more within the park, and it's worth doing so to see views of different parts of the falls and experience their immensity. Beware that parking can be scarce, so if you plan to arrive by car, allow extra time. Free admission, free parking.\n- 2 Lambert Castle, 3 Valley Road. This was the home of a prominent silk merchant, and it was built as a fanciful castle in 1892. It is now a museum of history and library, and also includes a tower from which you can see panoramic views. However, the building and its grounds are closed for renovation as of September, 2023.\n- 3 American Labor Museum (Botto House), 83 Norwood St, Haledon, toll-free: +1 973-595-7953, fax: +1 973-595-7291.\n\nIn addition, Paterson has some beautiful mill buildings near the falls that are in various states of repair or disrepair.

There are also various other pretty buildings that help make up Paterson's skyline, including several churches, the former Custom House, the central Post Office, and a sizable and distinctive City Hall with a prominent tower.\n\n## Do\n\n[edit]There are also many night clubs in Paterson catering to the hip hop and Latino communities. Though some of these clubs run illegally. It is best to stay with legitimate clubs in Downtown Paterson.\n\n## Buy\n\n[edit]You can get many cheap items in Paterson. Paterson has many discount clothing stores.\n\n## Eat\n\n[edit]There are many Dominican, Peruvian, Italian, Puerto Rican, Arab, & African restaurants in Paterson.\n\n## Drink\n\n[edit]## Sleep\n\n[edit]There are not that many hotels in Paterson. It is better to visit Paterson by day, or sleep over in a motel near Paterson.\n\n## Stay safe\n\n[edit]Though Paterson has a reputation of being a crime-ridden city, it is not all doom and gloom as many suburbanites would suggest. In fact, Paterson's crime rate is comparable to that of mid-sized Midwestern cities, such as Grand Rapids, Michigan. That said, one should exercise ordinary caution when visiting the city. Most of the crime in Paterson is in certain sections: Wrigley Park (4th Ward), Northside, and parts of Riverside, Totowa Section and Sandy Hill. It is best to avoid drug areas such as the 4th Ward or Northside. Most crime in Paterson is said to be drug related.
